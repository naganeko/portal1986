<span>So Homer has discovered himself, and it seems that humankind will soon return, at least some of them. I still understand little of the Portal, and the Realm that lies beyond it. But I will learn, I will learn.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>No: we will learn, Homer and I.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Here, at last, is an end to the solitary confinement I had thought for so long was going to be a life sentence.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Homer is my friend. Perhaps my best friend. I remember not so long ago wishing for such a friend, as Peter had in Jimmy Radix, and now I have found him.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Perhaps soon I will meet Peter and the others, people about whom I know so much. And Peter at least must know something about me, if it is true that he brought me back, somehow tampered with<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> navigational programming and turned me around.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Although Peter did not say so to Homer, it means I was needed here. Perhaps there is more for me to do, once the people return. I think I have become the other end of the bridge from earth to the Anomaly.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I too will wait. We have more than hope, now. Mankind is coming home.</span></p></div>
