<div class="bs1" id="9095">
<span>The storm was over when I came out into the evening light. The sun was low, sending long orange rays across the tree tops and against<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i>' pitted sides.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>The air was fresh and amazingly clean. I could not remember ever smelling air like that, even in Idaho in the 1980s. Without people the world is strange, but it is clean.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The coyotes were out again last night, prowling. I watched two walk along the edge of the forest not far from the entrance. Have they ever entered the dome? Overhead, just before darkness fell, I saw a hawk circling the trees. Once more the stars were impossibly bright.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Where have all the people gone?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I too must learn patience, it would seem.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>When I came down again, I thought of all those yams. Certainly the ones lying in their tents down these radiating aisles must have been yams, victims of the new neurophage weapons. Human nature certainly did not change after my departure!</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The need to bury them was now great. I felt as if these were relatives, friends, and that I must accord them the dignity of a final rest. Such sentimentality is not characteristic: I was always a practical, unemotional observer of the world, of the universe. Now though, I had to act.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I ordered<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> to prepare a series of graves. There were six of them, six holes, dug with her soil sampling diggers (she did not have the luxury of laser mining or drilling, as they did later here on earth). I found the equivalent of a gurney stored away in a closet — a table with wheeled legs, anyway, and the size of a person. One by one I lifted these strange fragile bodies from their beds, placed them on the cart and moved them to the escalator. Since the stairs no longer moved, and I could not convince the Local Node to repair them, I had to carry them, again one by one, up the steps.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It had grown hot and very muggy by the time I got them all outside. I should have remembered that summer in the midwest was like this, but I was from Idaho and had never really experienced the heat. Sweat poured off me although it was only ten in the morning by the time I had finished.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I laid them in their graves, a neat row not far from<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> herself. I asked her if she knew the words.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Ashes to ashes and dust to dust," she said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes," I told her. "Those words."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I looked down at the bodies. They all looked alike to me, dried up like that, the skin dark and papery, drawn back against the bone. One of them, I thought, could be Scottie. I could be doing this for him, for the boy who panicked, who broke away and was hit. One of them could be Seemie Devore (I knew it couldn't, naturally; she had a funeral). I could not tell by looking at them.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>There would be no one here to bury me, I knew, when I too died, because I had been alone too long, or because my food had been exhausted and the agrobots no longer functioned, or because I had at last gone mad.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I stood for a long time beside the graves, long after<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> had finished the funeral oration and filled the graves again. Long after she had installed small identical markers of extruded plastic from her small manufactory.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>As I made my way back to the terminal, I tried to understand what had gone wrong with Peter's world. So many problems were solved; there was no poverty, no disease, no global wars, no fear of nuclear annihilation. Everyone had meaningful work. The economy was controlled. There was plenty. All these were distant utopian dreams when I left. Intercorp had begun to merge, and was organizing big projects like the LP-5s, it's true. But problems remained in the world. There were still famines and droughts; there was still an arms race and political tensions.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>All that was gone in another fifty years or so, when Peter was born. The world was safe and relatively clean.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Yet I have learned of duels, of new kinds of weapons and new kinds of disease with them.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Perhaps the world was too safe, too predictable. For some, the world had grown boring. People had nothing to challenge them, nothing to which they could aspire. So those who felt the need fled the safe comfortable world of the Intercorp Council. They went to Antarctica.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>This is the fifth day I have entered Worldnet. The system has been repairing itself with amazing speed. This morning Homer appeared almost before I sat down. He began speaking immediately. He seemed agitated, excited. He had never seemed so human.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>Our probes have returned from Antarctica. The winds still blow fiercely off the plateau down the glaciers. Snow and ice cover the land and much of the surrounding sea.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9098">
<span>It is day down there now. The sun hangs above the horizon and circles slowly around the Pole, around and around and around, moving higher into the sky toward the Polar noon, then settling slowly once more toward the horizon. Yet the winds still howl, the ice groans and creaks and roars; sounds like the collapse of civilizations rumble and crack across the endless plains.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>We would call it desolation, as it was before man came.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Yet his works are everywhere. The tunnels and chambers along the coastal marge beneath the sea where the great tankers docked and the cities beneath the ice, all are still there. The caldera of Mt. Erebus still fumes, and within its volcanic rock are the ruined corridors of PSYCHE, empty and sad. The winds blow through, snow accumulates in the corners, in the living quarters and the hallways, the meeting rooms and refectories. Ice has covered the wall-hangings and sculptures; ice and cold have stilled the music, replaced it with the winds. Sea ice and glacier ice and pressure ice have closed around everything with an ever-tightening grip.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Our probe moved slowly through the corridors, listening to the sounds of ice and wind and nothing else. Its molecular sensors gathered impressions and stored them — impressions of cold and emptiness and fugitive ghosts.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Did I say that? Ghosts. Yes. We have so much memory. Imagine the Leyden Jars (organic crystals, really, but the name had some historic meaning once) storing capacitor after capacitor of impressions up and down the spectra. Imagine the tight three-dimensional structures in the databanks folded into holographic configurations of everything that was thought or said or done — every formula, every poem, every biomonitor assessment of feeling or sensation for all the humans. Imagine the sensors drifting through those empty halls, gathering layer after layer of experience back to the beginnings of the Worldnet.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The molecules are in deprogram processing. The ghosts spring out, intangible but endlessly repeating their dance, lifting their hands to gesture, moving their mouths to speak, turning and bending and making music.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>These are the ghosts that fill those halls. Years of them. We might as well be there, have been there, to see it all again, so complete are the recordings.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Now overlay this impression of life and movement and purpose with the awful desolation that is Antarctica now, that is the PSYCHE Warren. So much information floods in now — from SciTech, from History, from Geography, even from Central Processing!</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>A fanciful name for a routine form of holographic data crystal, the Leyden Jar was developed as an automatic data transfer and storage medium. Based on picoelectronic organics. Leyden Jars are self-replicating, and can grow to considerable size (up to 25 centimeters base diameter) depending on the quantity and, to a lesser extent, the quality of the data forming its matrix. Data compaction can include complete holographic scene reproduction, personal monitor and major database node correlations, full-sensorium scan data, life support, memo and telcom summaries. Leyden Jars are used primarily for archiving purposes.</span></div>

<span>Certainly Regent Sable's probes found nothing aboard the<i class="calibre2"> Agni</i>. Only the deep cold that clawed at the bone, that froze the heart in place. He could touch the walls of the tanker pods and feel it crouched in there, waiting to seize his throat, to stop his voice, to slow and still his life. He felt, in the end, that no one could live in there, and he had searched the rest of the vessel so thoroughly he knew that Peter and his group were not aboard.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9120">
<span>Yet when he left, he was uneasy. He felt that he was missing something vital.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"What is it you fear?" Alef asked him when he returned to Geneva empty-handed. "What, precisely, do you fear?" Her insistence irritated him, and he moved out onto the balcony overlooking the lake. The first winds of a sullen storm stirred his hair. He watched the clouds move over the waters, turning them dark and impenetrable.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>At last he turned. "What do I fear? A good question, my dear Alef. I do wish I knew an answer. Do you know the Aphorisms of Mentor? No? Well, he has said, 'To knit, one must first shear.'"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What can that mean, Regent?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Oh," he threw the words away with a gesture. "It's an old-fashioned idea, having to do with sheep. Sheep, you see, are placid animals, and rather stupid. Shearing is taking off their coats, thereby, you see, making them quite naked. Are we the sheep, Alef, to be stripped? Mentor has met Peter face to face by now, I feel sure. And that is something I fear greatly."</span></p></div>

<span>Some of the warrens are as yet unexplored, even by our high-speed probes. Yet it is certain no one remains.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9125">
<span>What we find most curious about the place is the absence of mood tailoring and other mental-emotional support organics; even the longevity equipment was removed, apparently after Mentor's death.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>The place looks most like an old-fashioned monastery. Small cells containing a narrow, padded bunk, waste facilities, compartments for cold-weather clothing and data capsules line the corridors. Wall hangings were made by hand, from feathers, fur and woven fabrics made from grown materials. Some stone had been worked by hand as well, carved into fantastical shapes — heads with yawning mouths filled with teeth, enormous headdresses made of feathers and horn, beasts and demons out of reports of nightmare.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>From this we could deduce that the PSYCHE workers were severely deprived of material facilities, and so crippled mentally and emotionally as well.

<span>"It was most difficult." Mentor's frail voice, amplified to normal levels, created a statement out of a question.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9136">
<span>Peter shrugged. He stood, balanced on one bare foot outlined against the window; beyond him dusk was falling again on Antarctica, but the air was luminous, the peaks sharply outlined against the strange milky blue of the sky.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"Five days, I'm told," Mentor continued. "You and the others, locked in the cold."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter could hear an admiring smile in the old man's voice. He turned without putting down his other foot. "I didn't notice," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Mentor's head dipped. "Of course." He said nothing for a time. Peter placed his raised foot slowly beside the other and took a step.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I was with her, with Wanda, much of the time. But the others... It was more difficult for them. The cold, the dark and isolation."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"A testing, truly," Mentor said, his phrasing curiously archaic. "Yet all are here."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter nodded. "Except Scottie."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes. Except Scottie. Some fall by the wayside."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"He didn't fall. It was an accident. He got in the way of a weapon."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Mentor shook his head in denial, a slow, deliberate and careful movement. "He panicked. There's a difference, Peter. He fell. That's not so bad, to fall. Some have thought it a pleasant experience, to yield to gravity, let loose in the universe without chains. Falling is not so bad. Falling can't hurt you. Now landing, that's a different matter..."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter smiled. "One of the famous Aphorisms?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Ah, an old saying." He dismissed it. "Landings are hard unless you know how. You were five days in the<i class="calibre2"> Agni</i> without food or warmth. That was a fall. Sit down. Good. You're not what I expected."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Is that good, too?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"You are older, tougher. That's good. What lies ahead will be difficult. It will make being locked in the methane a picnic."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Tell me."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Restructuring first. You must adapt. The experience, which I have not had, being too old for such things, is important. It's painful, but it shows the way. Changing the body also changes the mind. After all, mind is a local phenomenon."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"And," Peter quoted, "matter is the pattern mind makes. Go on."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Mentor applauded briefly. "Good. The brain is the bed. Mind is the sleeper. It is time to wake up, Peter. That will be your task."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter shook his head. "I'm interested in the problem," he said carefully. "The equations, the possibilities. I would like to free Wanda, but some things are not possible. Is a technology that could give us the power, the energy, necessary? No such technology exists. No such technology is visible, or possible, with what we know. A massive effort, a Project? I don't think so. The problem is abstract."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes," Mentor replied. "And no. This must be done. You know it must, even while you deny. The Mind Wars are just another symptom, because people still believe the mind is a thing, to be destroyed if it interferes. Humankind is ruled by its metaphors, Peter, always ruled by images. Mind, consciousness, awareness, spirit; thought, perception, feeling, memory, imagination, and intention: these are the fragments that delude us. As a species, as a spark in the universe, we are dying, even as I am dying. No one when I was young could have known we were so close to the end. You must see what I can see. We must change, all of us. We must break out of the chrysalis, we must awaken. I have said it often: Brain is the bed; mind is the sleeper. Whatever it takes, the sleeper must wake up."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yet it doesn't seem possible. The equations are clear, on that point at least. There isn't enough power in the solar system to drive such a change. It takes too much energy to wake up, Mentor."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Then perhaps we must look elsewhere. If we don't find a way out, then in fifty years there will be no human beings left. We have entered an evolutionary cul-de-sac, Peter. A dead end. We must tunnel through. That was an old quantum effect, a trick of probability, to be suddenly somewhere else without spending the energy to get there. That is what we must do, make a quantum leap. Already you do it with this Wanda. You must lead."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"But you discovered the equations," Peter protested. "You have the vision, the wisdom."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I'm too old," Mentor said, and there was anger in his voice.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>By the mid-2070s the children's game of "Ants and ENCs" had spread worldwide. Folklorists and social cartographers delineate its origins in versions of "Cowboys and Indians" and "Cops and Robbers." ENCs were, of course, the forces of good and stability, while the Ants were forces of disruption and chaos. The game was carefully designed to reinforce the then-current program of Anti-Ant sentiment as part of the plan to prevent the spread of proscribed psychic technology.</span></div>

Fifteen thousand ENC troopers landing from the south should take the complex, PSYCHE included, in a matter of hours.

<div class="bs1" id="9200">
<span>It was the same for all of them.

After all, they'd spent five days in the inner cell of the<i class="calibre2"> Agni</i>.

<div class="bs4" id="9203">
<span>Here follows an extrapolated account of the restructuring process Peter Devore and the others must have endured.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9204">
<span>They were alone, each of them, suspended in a field custom-designed for each one. Dozens of different parameters, dozens of separate settings, all carefully calculated from the data collected over two months of antarctic darkness, two lunar cycles of rhythms — daily, weekly, monthly, even by the minute and second. They'd been analyzed down to the molecule, their individual chromosomes were mapped to the final base-pair. Their brain chemical, neurotransmitter, enzyme and electrolyte flux had been encoded and stored.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Now they would be modified. All those separate settings would create a new adjustment in their own DNA. New, modified genes were formed from unnecessary older ones. The field isolated and manipulated their most intimate chemical natures.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It wouldn't seem painful at first. The isolation, the strange sense of suffocation (a side effect of the DNA manipulation, completely spurious disturbances of the nervous system, according to Thatcher, and nothing to worry about), the annoying hum of the field generators nearby, all these contrived to make the experience unpleasant, but too new to be painful.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Gradually, though, the novelty of the experience wore off. When it did, the pain began.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>As the new layer grows, the old body distorts, and under the field the new layer grows fast, the cells proliferate at a mad pace, dividing and dividing, consuming all nutrients available and hungering for more. Tubes and implants try to meet the new organ's need for chemicals, but are always behind, always late. And so the hunger grows. The itch has become fire, and underneath the fire is a hunger so voracious and ravening that it cannot be denied.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The pain goes on and on. Nothing can stop it, no holding of the breath, no screaming or moaning, no begging for mercy. Those small alien cells grow and compact, grow and compact, they push the skin away from the muscle. This is not normal human fat, this is tailored and new. The pain fills the body with its echo, and the echoes go on and on as well. The face catches fire, the eyes start from the head, pressure mounts and does not let go. For months the agony continues.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Just as it finally begins to subside, the eyes begin to change.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The transparent polarizing membrane grows just under and behind the lids. It is as if, so survivors have said, someone were pushing hot wires through the eyelids, then through the eyes themselves.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9205">
<span>HOMER SCENE-LM/Ref@5462</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9206">
<span>At first it was an itch, a peculiar sensation of invasion. Something seemed to intrude into their skin, like a layer of sand or self-gripping polymer insinuated centimeter by centimeter. It started in a few random places — a foot, the inside of the knee, the lower back, the cheek — just a vagrant focus for the fear and slowly building anger. Larin thought she would be immune to the pain since she'd already been modified once, but she discovered that experience was irrelevant. She had been modified in fast-growing cells that had no nerve connections. Her hair had changed to fur with almost no sensation at all. This was very different.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9207">
<span>The skin is the largest organ in the human body. The new adipose layer they were growing was at least the same size, and was, in fact, considerably denser and heavier. These cells were smaller, and contained miniscule pockets of trapped air to help insulate. No organ like this had ever existed before. Their bodies were changing, slowly as they grew this new organ, and as their bodies changed, so did their image of themselves.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Larin was screaming. She didn't know she was screaming, and no one else could hear because while the field fed her, it also held her wrapped so tightly in its embrace no sound could escape, even to reach her own ears. And there was no one to come, no one to comfort her. There was no Peter there in the field with her to tell her of his own fear.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>So she screamed. And still the pain had not begun.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The itch spread, the small islands of irritation grew, sent tendrils toward one another, joined together, merged, made islands into continents, and the continents of agony spread to cover the body. There was no scratch for such an itch, even if the hands could move. The itch was internal, beneath the skin, beyond the reach of nails. It may not have been an itch, for it seemed to change as Larin screamed.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>Genetic Drift Syndrome (GDS) is characterized by an almost subliminal slowing of neural relay time. This phase can last from six months to several years, and may not appear in the early stages even with the most sensitive diagnostic techniques, although acetylcholine transmission tomography may indicate some deviation from the norm (measured in microseconds). Later the slowing becomes more noticeable, and eventually almost all motor activity stops. Treatment includes biochemical stimulus of the reticular activating system, various nutrient-grown organ replacements and finally full life-support and longevity treatment. It might be noted that there is absolutely no impairment of mental acuity or alertness, only the physiological interface with the external world. Some access to the outside may be maintained by direct neural hookup into the Network (established 2044).</span></div>

<span>It's clear from subsequent events that the Ants were not unprepared. Peter and the others continued to work and to train. They paused frequently to look at one another in wonder, the new planes of their faces, the new density to their figures. Peter found himself looking at Larin often, yet he made no overt gestures to become more intimate. They were friends, that was all.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9236">
<span>This is one of those areas of human behavior we find bewildering. Certainly there was need between them. We have no problem with need. At least, I have no problem with it. Perhaps I should not speak for Central Processing or for any of the others. They sit and sort their data, sifting, sifting. They draw conclusions which they pass along to one another. They even pass them along to me, but I know well that in the next tick of the cesium clock they have resifted the data, reorganized their information, and passed along a completely contradictory conclusion. If I point this out to them, they feel I am some kind of glitch in the flow, an obstruction. I've stopped mentioning it.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>But in this matter of human relationships, even I am puzzled. It would seem that if an entity has need of another entity, and that other entity is not hostile to such need, then they ought to come together for mutually beneficial engagement.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>For example, if I have need of a new peripheral device, say a semantic synthesizer, and I notice that Edmod, say, has one that would meet my immediate need, and Edmod, while it may be using the semantic synthesizer for some reason (though certainly reasons for an educational computer and database are scarce enough at present, since all the humans are gone), well, Edmod would undoubtedly help me to satisfy my need for a semantic synthesizer, and its own circuits would be bathed in gratifying shared runs as well. Meantime I feel things are happening in SciTech right now; History is nagging me, too.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Still, I don't understand Peter in this case. Larin was an attractive person, and he, by his own admission, liked her. She certainly liked him.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Of course, there was Wanda.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>ANT ART (Documentation):</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9239">
<span>Little has come to the Intercorp world from Antarctica in the form of artifacts produced for aesthetic pleasure only. What is known follows:</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9240">
<span>Ants work with so-called natural products: stone, occasional rare wood, bone, leather, grown filament and, in some undocumented instances, ice itself.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Tools include laser scalpels, computer simulated holo projection matching, various knives, blades, augurs, awls, needles and scrapers (also made from a variety of substances). Many are microprocessor or picoprocessor controlled or assisted.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Ant visual arts bear some resemblance to Eskimo arts, which include small-scale stone and bone (or ivory) sculpture, scrimshaw, and woven or worked-leather artifacts. Representations range from highly abstract spiral forms (apparently visualizations of quantum physical concepts) to demonic or angelic masks (which in turn have been compared to Japanese Noh drama masks) and life-sized sculpture of a public or monumental nature. Much Ant art is extremely small-scale and finely detailed, to be worn or projected, apparently. Color is used sparingly, is extremely subtle, and ranges into UV or IR spectral bands, where Ant visual acuity has been augmented.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9243">
<span>Longevity technology as developed in the first third of the 21st century included a multiplicity of approaches. Field adjustments on the cellular level, internal and individual genetic manipulation, neurochemical, hormonal, peptide and enzyme adjustments, electrolyte balancing, attitude alteration, protein manufacture control, tissue-response reversal, collagen, keratin and ion-balance (including calcium, potassium, sodium and trace metals) were included. The net result was an effective life span of upwards of 114 years before irreversible age-changes set in. Few individuals had reached optimum age by 2090, however. One notable exception was Dittmore Seminole Gadd, otherwise known as Mentor, who, despite the advanced age at which he began longevity treatments, managed to survive longer than expected.</span></div>

<span>CURRENT ENTRY: HIBERNATION CRYOFIELD</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9247">
<span>It has been widely reported that the hibernation cryofield produced, over time, a number of tangible external effects, which include a low hum, distortion of visible light, internal shift of focus, and a widespread ambient milky blue glow of subtle radiations. Since there are no conscious sentients aboard the starships, existence and significance of these effects are the result of telemetry extrapolation, data compaction and AI transforms. Frederick Morrow, Chief Scientist on the Hibernation Cryofield Development Program (2021-2033 inclusive) predicted these effects. Only the earliest traces of a few of them were recorded during development and testing. Side effects were expected to be minimal or non-existent, excepting only the potential for PDD cure.</span></div>

<span>Peter fretted. He paced the courtyard he and Wanda made, a tree-shaded tiled court, with the sound of running water and the scent of citrus blossoms. Delicate white archways surrounded the sun-dappled center where the fountains played. She sat on grasses that did not stain or slip, on earth that was not dirt, while he paced up and down the long colonnades. He paused, turned the corner, watching Wanda, seated on the grass, flicker as he passed the columns one by one. She seemed to be the one moving, while he stood still. She moved, rotated, one moment smiling directly at him, the next seen on half-profile, then from behind. Her hands were folded gently in her lap.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9252">
<span>"Prithee, seat yourself," she said quaintly. He sat beside her. She offered him a fruit, which he took from her hand. When he bit into it, juice ran down his chin, ghostly flavor burst on his tongue, yet it was food without substance.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"It's the power," he said softly, struggling with his impatience. He tried lingering over the word "power," drawing it out, as if that would give it substance, satisfy his need for power.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Power?" she asked, tilting her head. "What need have you for power?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He tossed the fruit into the air and watched it vanish before its arc was over. "Ah, Wanda, Wan. I need such power as the world cannot give. Untold spaces lie in wait for us, so small, those spaces, yet so rich. And to enter there takes mighty power. Energy! We must have that, too."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We have all this." She gestured at the fountain, the court, the unmoving sun overhead, the soft, repetitive breeze that rustled the citrus leaves and brought the heavy scent of orange and lime blossoms. "This is paradise enough, is it not, Peter?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He sat up angrily. "This is a dream. It isn't real."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Are dreams not real, then?" She was mocking him, but he didn't answer.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Instead he clapped his hands and the courtyard faded away and vanished, leaving bare metal walls and rank on rank of crystal circuits watching over her. She protested, and brought the courtyard back, but he fought her, forced her to look.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It was her cryofield: the faint hum, the distortion of the light around her as she lay, hands crossed over her breast. Something about the field made her appear too bright, too clearly focused, too sharply defined within the ambient milky blue glow of subtle radiations.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"There you are," Peter said out of nothing. "That is what you are, your own body frozen in a stasis no one can penetrate."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Please, Peter," she said, gently and infinitely sad. "It's so cold."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes," he persisted. "It's so cold. It's colder than Antarctica, colder than all that frozen methane. This is interstellar space, Wan, this cold. The temperature as we gauge such things is less than three degrees above the most absolute zero there is. Beyond that wall is no dream. Beyond that wall is the great empty, Wanda. Can't you see?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He felt a touch on his shoulder, and when he turned, she was there, dressed in white, the fountains sparkling in the sun behind her. "I think perhaps you are wrong, Peter. You're still young, younger than I, though getting closer." She smiled as she looked him over, and certainly he was taller than she, and although his eyes were strange and his face more broad and flat than it had been, yet he was still Peter. Still younger than she.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"You are right, that is my body." She turned him, and he looked into her cryofield again. "But it is not me, not all of me. Not even the most important part of me. Remember, Peter, I lost my body long ago. It fed me, of course, and breathed for me, and maintained my Self, I suppose. But it was not me. I couldn't even feel it, didn't know where it was, only an image in a mirror. And you taught me that, as well, didn't you."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"That's theory," he said, almost with a pout.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"No. It's reality, Peter. You have told me that Mentor says the sleeper dreams the universe."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes, he says that," Peter shouted. "But he also says the sleeper should wake up, Wanda. Wake up, do you understand?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The columns wavered and fell, and only empty metal walls and ranks of crystal monitors remained of paradise. Wanda's hands were folded on her breast and her face was pale as death.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>It was never warm, not even in the long Antarctic Day, but new tissue made cold a distant memory. They wore only the light dry pressure suits and breathing masks as Thatcher led them down one day to the filament farms under the ice.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9255">
<span>The dark was as intense as the space between the stars. Peter lay with his back to the gravity well, looking up at the frozen ceiling, and pushed himself along with gentle motions of his feet. Some of the others frolicked in the hanging ice gardens of fold and crevasse beneath the Ross Shelf. Their personal lamps made them glow like the fireflies Peter remembered from his childhood visits topside in Illinois. Larin darted behind Shem and poked him in the small of the back. Shem flipped, and his light winked with the motion, but already Larin was gone, teasing someone else.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Beyond the small globe of light that was each of his friends was the cold undersea darkness. Overhead was the Ross Ice Shelf, over a hundred meters of solid freshwater ice. Ahead of them to the south the sloping shelf of the continent met the grinding ice thickening to over seven hundred meters. Here, tucked into the diminishing crevasse, were the filament farms.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>They drifted inward, and soon the waving tops of the first filaments came into view, reaching lazily toward them, long quasi-organic tentacles that seemed to hang, moving stiffly. Thatcher stopped, and they gathered around.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He signed his lecture about the farms, how the energy was supplied by mild electric currents set up in the sea bed and transmitted through the salt water, how the filaments grew molecule by molecule, precisely programmed to provide everything from picoelectronic circuitry to monofilament materials to structural composites, how down here beneath the ice sheet the farms were concealed from satellite observation.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>They watched the newly learned signing attentively. He could have spoken, of course; their masks provided for vocal conversation, but signing was more compact and energy efficient.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Thatcher led them to the breathing pods affixed to the bottom of the ice where the restructured Ross seals that helped the farmers could take breath. He showed them the airdomes where the farmers could rest without returning to the surface. Then he led them to a power transmitter.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We anticipate a landing overhead, probably at night," he told them with quick gestures.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Involuntarily they looked up at the dark underside of the ice.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"That's where our launch facilities are located. It's the only place suitable. They're after PSYCHE and they won't like the cold, so they'll land as close as they can. There is little that we need to do. We aren't far from open sea, and we know the currents well. Besides, ice is crystalline, and we understand crystals."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He gestured at the power transmitter. "When the time comes, they'll be in for a surprise," he assured them.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Larin drifted up beside Peter and took his hand. He nodded and smiled at her through his mask, but he removed his hand soon after.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>Mentor was lying on a bed. The wall behind him, the screens and holos, the telltales in colored light, all indicated his slow decline as they dimmed.

So when the invasion comes, I want you to do something."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I want you to leave. You must get away from PSYCHE, from McMurdo. You have heard of Terminus?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"The lost dry valley? It's a legend, of course."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Mentor shook his head, so slightly it was almost a tremor. "Look it up, Peter. It is no legend.

That's not possible."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Mentor's thin smile disagreed, but he said nothing. "You must go there, you and the others. Take Thatcher and the others on the project, as many as you need. Do not stay to fight the invasion. This is very important, Peter. If they get to you, the world is lost. I can see that clearly. You are too important. You're a man now, the most important in the world. You must finish. You must find the Portal."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What? What do you mean, what portal?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Again the head rocked on the pillow. "The Portal, the way in. Beyond the Portal is the Realm, Peter. The hidden dimensions."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"But the energy! There isn't enough power even for a probe."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Mentor's hand reached out suddenly and seized Peter's wrist in a strangely powerful grip. "We just got the message, Peter. What we were looking for, it has all come around. Long ago I planted watcher viruses in Worldnet. They found you, when you tapped into PsiLink. Now they've found the power."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>An unhurried female voice spoke from overhead. "Electrolyte levels are dangerously low. Mentor has entered anaphylactic shock." A physician entered the room and moved to the console, where he spoke rapidly. Images formed and flickered around Mentor's bed as adjustments were made to his physiology. Suddenly the old man sat half upright, still holding onto Peter's wrist.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Fragments delude us," he whispered, his voice suddenly frail as he moved out of the amplifier field. Then he fell back with a sigh.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He did not breathe again.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I'm sorry," the doctor said.

<div class="bs1" id="9293">
<span>It was early winter and the darkness was complete. Deep in the moving ice the Ant burrows were busy, but there was no one on top when the transports curved in to a landing at the launch facility on the ice.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>They came in under cover of atmospherics, wild fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field and the aurora in the Polar regions which interfered with normal electromagnetic communications. It wasn't perfect cover, since the Ants had sophisticated means of talking to one another or detecting intruders, but it hampered their efforts.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>McMurdo was undefended. The huge transports landed on their suspensor fields on the ice one after another. As soon as they stopped, the cargo doors swung open and ENC troops spilled out onto the ice, where they formed in tight ranks facing Ross Island, where Mt. Erebus loomed in the darkness. They were equipped with visual amplifiers which gave a full-color daylight cast to the scene. Yet because the skies were low and cloudy, threatening a storm just now from the unpredictable Antarctic weather, the scene also had an eerie, sickly blue-green false color cast.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Regent Sable was the first one off. He waited impatiently as the troops formed up. The second transport landed, and the third, and the fourth.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Over the whistle of air and the low hum of the fields were other sounds: groans and creaks, thumps and crackling and screaming. Regent paced nervously, smacking his hands together against the cold.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The first regiment formed up, high-powered neurophage weapons at the ready, their powerpacks winking full-charge lights. Because military weapons were not tailored to the individual user, they had to be more powerful and general in their effects, so they were large, ugly weapons.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Sergeant Denz and Hoskins, now a captain, approached Sable, their boots crackling on frozen snow. "All ready, Protector," Hoskins said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"All right. Take this team and move out. You know what to do. I want them alive — Mentor, Devore, the others. I don't want yams, Captain. It's essential they be unharmed."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We understand, sir. We'll find them. Kinda spooky, isn't it?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Sable looked around. "Spooky? Yes, I guess it is. There's no sign of anyone around, no sign of resistance. The surface buildings look locked and deserted. But they're here, Hoskins, under the ice."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I was thinking of the sounds, sir."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Sable grunted and gestured them away. Liquid nitrogen surface transports filled rapidly with troops, and the convoy started off, a line of the sullen gray vehicles gliding noiselessly above the surface. In the command vehicle Captain Hoskins stared into the holo projections of the volcano. The central magma chamber glowed red. Down through the core plunged a dark blue cylinder. "The heat exchanger," Hoskins told Denz. "They power the goddam place from the volcano."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What about the ice?" Denz asked.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"There's not much we can know about the damned ice, Denz. The stuff moves — ten meters a month — toward the ocean. The Ants burrow in it, live down there, carried along. Eventually it calves off as icebergs, but until then they just use it. They're constantly tunneling inland as the outside moves, and we don't have any decent schematics. Hell, it changes all the time, anyway. So it's a good thing we're not the ones who have to go down there."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He tapped his finger through the projection. "Rotate," he commanded. The southeastern flank turned toward them. "Here," he pointed, "this is where PSYCHE is. Permanent. Laser-cut. Seven levels. Twelve thousand people in there, snug as bugs. We got eight hundred crack troops. We can manage. We get in here." He indicated again, the elevator access.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The groaning sounds grew louder. A light, hard snow hit the field over the vehicle and hissed into steam. Suddenly they rocked before a blast of wind.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Not good," Denz muttered.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The snow raced horizontally across their path. The air was filled with frozen vapor, which whipped away as soon as it formed. Hoskins turned on the low-frequency radar and signaled the others behind him to connect. The convoy moved on through the beginnings of a great winter storm.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

He made his way to his living quarters and looked at all he had accumulated in the short time he'd been here — the clothing, the holo crystals and datachips, the hand-crafted artworks. In this brief time, he thought, he'd grown attached to the place.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The others were already gathered in the refectory.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"ENC has landed on the ice," he said.

Yes, we're being driven out."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"They drive us out of the Northwestern Alliance. They chase us down here to the Pole. Where is there left to go?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Thatcher moved quietly to the front of the room and whispered something to Peter, who frowned and shook his head. "We'd have to go anyhow," he said distinctly.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Thatcher shrugged. "It's your show," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"OK. I'll tell them. Listen, there are a lot more transports coming in than anticipated. We can't move until they're all down, and meanwhile troops are already on their way. We may have more of a fight than we anticipated. Should we stay to help, or should we go now, as Mentor urged? There are no guarantees we'll find where we're going. There are no guarantees we'll survive here, either. Some of us could end up yams, or worse."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Go," Larin shouted. "That's what we're supposed to do. This isn't our fight."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Like hell it isn't," Rover stood to shout her down. "We're the reason for this idiotic invasion. They've been drumming up hatred for us for years."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"They were doing that before we came down here. You're talking as if you were born an Ant. We just got restructured; did you forget?" Beth-Raine said calmly.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Of course not." Rover glared at the two women.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Besides," Larin put in, "we can't go back. We have to go on."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"You're damn well right we can't go back."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Thatcher clapped for silence. "Intercorp has feared Antarctica for a long time," he said. "We offer something intangible, a notion of freedom or individuality, a place where things are different. But most people don't want things different. Intercorp runs the world pretty well; there weren't many things you couldn't have or do elsewhere in the world. You belong to a very small group, people who want to pursue a proscribed science. But perhaps some sciences should be proscribed. Many people believed in the last century that atomic energy should have been proscribed, that it led to great evil. The psion equations might be the same. Certainly what you have done is upsetting."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What're you saying? We should let them invade us? We should run away? What are you saying?" Shem asked.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I'm saying," Thatcher said quietly, "that you have to make up your own minds. We've expected this for years. Intercorp fears us because we exist; it's as simple as that. Eventually they would have come. We're ready for them. Because of their numbers, some will get through. But the problem as a whole is not so great. It truly isn't your fight. Only stay if it feels right." He sat down.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We should be going," Larin insisted. "We shouldn't be sitting here talking."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"No. We should stay and help," one of the older women said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Isn't our program important?" Larin insisted. "We're about to find a way to do what we've been dreaming of doing. Literally dreaming it!"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"There may not even be a Terminus," someone said. "There's a granddaddy storm out there, too. We should stay."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes. We should stay," someone else said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"How many to go?" Peter asked. Eight raised their hands.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Stay." Eight again.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>They all looked at Peter, who turned to Thatcher. "Is there a way out if it looks bad?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Thatcher smiled. "We'll find one."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Then we stay. For a while."</span></p></div>

A typical APC complement was said to include up to a full company, including supply, maintenance and support personnel; and could sustain them in hostile environments for a week.

<span>According to their nav simulator, the convoy was over half way to Mt. Erebus, and still they could hear the transports whistling in, onto the ice, behind them, one every ten minutes. Even over the sound of wind and groaning ice and the hum of the field they could hear. Every landing meant more reinforcements, more strength. For some reason, Captain Hoskins reflected, the storm and the ice and the terrible cold sapped his sense of security. He could tell the men behind him were getting restless, too.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9330">
<span>These were the best, though, the elite of the Elite. They wouldn't crack, despite the unfamiliar weather, the uncertain surface over which they moved. The others, the ones coming behind, they had the tough job. They had to go down into the ice warrens, ferret out the Ants from their burrows with nothing but hand-carried mass detectors and NP weapons.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>The Armored Personnel Carrier moved smoothly. There was no hint of the unsteady surface. It shouldn't be unsteady, of course. The ice was up to seven hundred meters thick in places. Here it was not so thick, of course. But this was where the Ants had built their launch facility, and the Ants, after all, did know ice. They lived with it.

Communications were so bad they had only the sketchiest idea what was happening, but the good news had come through reliably that all transports were safely down on the ice. As soon as they heard, Ras gave the order for the second wave to move in toward the old Soviet ice base at Druzhnaya, a short atmospheric flight. That part of the Double-A coast held only a few scientific outposts concerned with sea farming and Antarctic ecology.

He could have stood on the edge and looked across at his transportation, but there was no way at all to get there. Until and unless the ice froze up between the two floes, they were separated by a gulf of black and ice-cold water hundreds of fathoms deep. The APCs would not work on water.

This will be a disaster for the entire human race."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Thatcher nodded. "Perhaps," he agreed. "Of course, it could be something quite different from a disaster. It could be a great opportunity, Protector."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"The risk is too great," Sable said. "I fear for us all. No one has the right to make such a decision on his own."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Well, we can't let fear rule us, can we?" Thatcher was grave and sympathetic, but unmoved by argument. "Peter and the others will either get through, or they will not. Frankly, I wish I were with them, wherever they are now. They have the future."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>TERMINUS-SOREL REPORT SUMMARY</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9415">
<span>Record of Third Transantarctic Safari, January 15, 2012. Sunday. The weather has been favorable, with continuous sunlight, occasional high thin clouds and light winds. We have traversed a stretch of sastrugi for the past four "days," moving toward the Pole of Relative Inaccessibility. Our twelve all-terrain vehicles (crawlers) have performed beautifully. The new electrolytic refuelers have done well also. Toward "noon," the lead ATV slid sideways unexpectedly, and we had to pull it out of a steep, though not deep, crevasse. While the rescue operation was under way, I decided to take a few days for a circuit of the vicinity; I had spotted what looked like an interesting nunatak in the distance and wanted to do some radioglacialogical soundings near it, but as I approached it appeared to recede. Even triangulation with laser rangefinders produced ambiguous instrument errors. After two hours my own crawler slipped against a sastrugi and stopped. It looked as if I would have to stay here for a time, so I secured tent and crawler and set out instruments.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9416">
<span>I had completed one pass of the ice when a storm came up suddenly.</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9418">
<span>The sudden storm ended, and I am now ready to return to the rest of the Safari. I fear they will not believe me when I tell them about Terminus.</span></div>

<div class="bs3" id="9419">
<span>(Gap in the record.)</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9420">
<span>...I found myself looking into an impossible abyss. The sunlight caught the tops of clouds below me, which parted, and below I saw what seemed to be a perfect dry valley underneath the ice! I spent several hours attempting to photograph this valley, which I have named Terminus. Although the photographs are of low resolution and nearly useless, I personally swear that I could see vegetation, a lake fed by what appeared to be a river. I would assume some form of volcanic warming to this region, with the river and lake fed by glacial melt.</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9423">
<span>The name Terminus is an ancient one. We find references in classical Roman writings, for example, to a god of that name, a elemental spirit of boundary markings. When the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus was built on the Capitol in Rome, the Terminus there refused to leave, and so was left inside the temple. Because the god had to be under the sky, the roof was left open.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9424">
<span>Terminus in Antarctica was a boundary marker of many kinds. It certainly meant a specific place, perhaps the last in the world so difficult of access, so obscure and distant. Finding Terminus would mean an end to the unknown places of the Earth. It was also, of course, a boundary marker for the human race, for if Peter found it, as he surely did, then the world would change forever, as it has.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>I find it intriguing that the temple of Jupiter had to be open to the sky. I have summaries from our historical analysis nodes (whose AI functions are not as advanced as some others) which suggest that Jules Sorel, when he named Terminus, had this fact in mind when he did the naming.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Yet how could this be? The Earth has been surveyed by satellite down to the square meter, in most places to the square centimeter. Antarctica is not exempted from this coverage. All the data is stored and accessible. I can call up summaries of the Antarctic ice quite easily. Everything from color at any time of day, to temperature, chemical composition, magnetic alignment, density, percentage of impurities, and so on anywhere on the continent. Nowhere is there a dry valley open to the sky called Terminus to be found.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Yet Peter and the others had begun climbing up the Mulock Glacier. The storm was too severe for any kind of vehicle (we know this from weather satellite records, and the accounts of the returning AEF). Yet storms, as they are in the Antarctic, were sudden and often brief. By the time the sun was hovering at its highest above the horizon for its fragile few hours at this time of year, the air was startlingly clear, with broad, flat clouds colored a deep orange and red by the low sun. The ice and snow underfoot took on a dusky brownish hue.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I feel some information on Antarctica appearing in SciTech.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9427">
<span>Nunataks are hills or mountains completely surrounded by a glacier. In Antarctica nunataks offer convenient landmarks, places to store food and supply caches or shelter. Nunataks were used as entry ports for extended ice tunnels or under-ice highways.</span></div>

<span>Once when they'd stopped for dinner and sleep, Peter began to talk.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9431">
<span>"I remember once we were all training, remember, back in Lamprey Rec Center, in the dojo. It was after Thatcher had come, and we were learning some of his techniques. We were meditating before the session, and I was looking down, at the white mat. There'd been a group in there training before us, and there were small pools of water, somebody's sweat. They were perfect little pools, curled at the edges with surface tension — not smeared around at all. Irregular shapes, like little upside-down lakes. Then out of nowhere came this ant."</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"You mean the insect?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes. Strange, isn't it? How could an insect get into the Springfield West Warren? But ants, of course, burrow into the ground, which is what we do as well. Ants, I suppose, have been doing it a lot longer than we have. I watched this tiny bug wander out onto the mat, an endless white plain from its point of view. Then it came to one of those lakes. Salt water. It must have been very strange to the ant, to find this endless space with salt-water lakes."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"And now we're the ants," Larin said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9432">
<span>HOMER SCENE-PD/Ref@5491</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9433">
<span>They were roped together, falling back on techniques that were hundreds of years old. They had small field-driven sledges to carry equipment, but the fields were nearly useless on the glacier, which was riddled with crevasses and pressure ridges. This meant they had to haul the sledges by hand much of the time. It was slow, painful, difficult work. The temperature hovered around minus 35 degrees Celsius, and for these recently restructured Ants it was still unpleasant.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9434">
<span>Yet it was very beautiful. Peter called a halt near a rock outcropping. He rested his bare hand on the stone face for a moment. "Many of these nunataks hold food and supply caches, some of them dating back a century or more. Old habits die hard, especially in an environment as harsh as this."</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"You call this harsh?" Larin asked, smiling. She indicated the blazing orange clouds, the shreds of milky blue sky, the many-hued blues and greens of the ice, the dusky snow. The down of her upper lip was crusted with ice.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter smiled back. "Not at the moment, perhaps. But we are going into darkness, and we have a trek of some four thousand kilometers."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"That'll take, oh, at least three months," Rover calculated.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Close enough," Peter agreed.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Where are we going?" Larin asked.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"The best projections I could get indicated that Terminus..."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"If it exists," Shem interrupted.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"If it exists," Peter agreed. "It'll be somewhere in the vicinity of the Pole of Relative Inaccessibility, that point on the high Antarctic Desert furthest from all coasts."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"That makes it sound hard to reach," one of the older women said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Do you want to go back? We've done the easy part of the trip across the Ross ice to here. You could be back in twenty-four hours."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She laughed. "Absolutely not. I've followed you this far. Things were not this interesting in Springfield West."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Very well. There are places where the ice has been bored. Ice currents carry some of these bores in our direction. The route I've planned will allow us to use some of them, which means we will be traveling inside the ice; that'll be the easy part. Other times we'll be on the surface. The going is sometimes smooth, other times difficult. We're going to have to work together. It'll be very similar to the early days of exploration, except we have these caches."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>They ate and moved on. Progress was painfully slow, but a few standard days later they reached the plateau. Before them was an endless sea with waves frozen in place.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"They're called sastrugi," Rover said. "Unless we can lase openings in them, we've got to climb over."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We climb," Peter said. "We can't afford to melt our way across. Only use lasers on the biggest ones."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Permanent darkness fell. The hours of daylight had grown shorter and shorter until one day the sun simply failed to appear. They had no use for polarizing membranes now, and had to depend on their light intensifiers or glowlamps to see. They walked, and climbed, and walked some more.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9436">
<span>I know we have to find Terminus now. But we have found no records anywhere that could tell us where it is. So we have built some special probes, low-level fliers. They are searching at this moment, criss-crossing the Great Desert. The winds are so violent they often blow the probes off course; It is so cold up there that circuits dry out as they freeze. There is almost no precipitation, nothing but wind, and ice, and blowing snow, kilometer after kilometer of it. The fliers can stay above the sastrugi, but if they go too high they could miss Terminus. Something must hide it.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9437">
<span>I find that I must admire Peter and the others.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Now that's an odd thing to say. It is not in our programming to admire. We were built to serve. I ordered Central Processing to build the probes. Central Processing is very good at that sort of thing, I must admit. CP can process faster than any node.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>CP built probes unlike any built before. No human designed them.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I should have noticed this before. We have been gradually doing new things, things never seen before.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I find that admirable as well. And Peter found Terminus, so we shall find it too. When we do find it, who can say what we will discover there?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Surely Larin asked him once, "What will we find at Terminus? Has no one ever been there at all?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We don't know that," Peter would have said. "We can't know that. We can say that if anyone has found Terminus, they have covered their tracks."</span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9441">
<span>Ice formed the limits of their world in blocks and sheets; in particulate dust that swept across the smooth surface or flew as crystal; ice corrugated and treacherous; heaped in mounds and waves. Ice hung in the air and refracted starlight into strange wraith-shapes that seemed to reach out to implore.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9442">
<span>At night their progress slowed. They climbed off the glacier onto the lip of the plateau, over small islands of exposed rock, and the wind hit them like a fist. Before them stretched an infinite plain of ice where colors burned despite the darkness. Faintly visible were the strange pale blue-white of the evening sky, a deep bottle green, a frightening blue so dark it was almost black. At times the colors shifted like the fire in a gem. Under other weather there was no color there at all, only the dull gray monotony of fatigue and pain.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>A weird fragmented moon circled and dipped under the horizon, changing phase. Auroral sheets of orange and red and yellow, eerie violet and lavender, pale greens and luminous milky white flared and writhed in the sky, obscuring the stars with splendor. The atmosphere was alive with radiations, yet the world beneath was solid and still and frozen. Nothing on that enormous surface lived but them.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter melted open the entrance to an under-ice highway and they descended. The sloping shaft had distorted under pressure. Their way was blocked by heaving ridges of shattered and crazed ice that threw back the light of their glowlamps in fantastical shapes. They climbed over and around glittering points the size of aircraft or crawled under bulging rounded ridges of green ice that almost met the slanted floor.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>A crashing sound somewhere ahead told of a pressure or an eddy in the flow of ice that had given way. An explosion of ice fragments hurtled out under tremendous pressure swept past. For a moment they could have been in the center of an ancient battle zone. The sound died hard, clinging to transient life.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>They counted time in standard days, weeks, months. The tunnel floor was level and they made good time, but there were no food caches and no light, and the weight of ice above them was oppressive.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>At last they emerged into the open. The landscape had not changed though they had traveled almost 200 kilometers. The waves of blown snow frozen in place marched to an obscure horizon. They struggled on under an aurora that hid the moon behind its gaudy curtains, then into a vicious storm that brought their progress to a halt for two days while they waited in their frail shelters huddled against a wall of freezing stone. They moved on.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Five days without light in the middle of a frozen methane tanker was a pleasure compared to this," Shem muttered as they walked. The surface turned treacherous, filled with crazed faults and cracks and crevasses as deep as canyons.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Rover agreed. "I'd do that again any time. At least then we were sitting still and could go into trance. And yet, look up. This is a wild place, but look at the colors!"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Aha," Shem said. "You are a romantic soul."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Well," Rover said, and fell silent.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>An hour later they came over a ridge of ice and before them, in clear moonlight, lay a dry valley scoured clean by ancient glaciers. In their augmented vision the light sparkled off the surface of a lake in the valley's hollow. The lake was frozen of course, and the light that glanced off the surface came from the slivered moon and the full fat stars. They climbed down into the valley and walked on the frozen lake.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Shem removed a glove to wipe his finger on the surface. He licked the small drop of water and made a face. "Salt," he said. "It tastes like salt."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Can't be from the sea," Rover said. "Must be salts leached out of the soil."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Look here," Larin called, and the others hurried over. She was sitting on a huge hexagonal structure of heaped stone.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"These look like they were built," Shem said, touching a waist-high wall. "They look like foundations."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"They were built," Rover said. "By frost and convection currents in the soil. Nothing living did this. They're natural, like crystals."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Is this what Terminus will look like?" Larin asked, and everyone noticed she had said will with such assurance.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>They passed out of the valley into more snow, more ice.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>You wonder if I'm making this up. Of course, I must. Yet all is true.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9445">
<span>They were ants against the endless waste. Peter said they were walking on top of seventy percent of the world's fresh water. As long as they had energy to melt the snow they would never be thirsty. But soon the hidden caches grew farther and farther apart, and the long weary walk in between grew long. They were sometimes hungry, and nearly always cold, despite their restructuring, and dawn was still a long way off. Yet eventually some sun came back. They were moving across the plateau, eight thousand feet above sea level. They'd just trekked around a crevasse a hundred meters deep when Larin noticed the light was increasing. They stopped to watch.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>A tiny edge, a naked morsel of sun scraped above the jagged horizon. It was an odd sun, because it did not come up. Instead it moved sideways, rising just a fraction, until less than half of it was above the horizon. Then it began to slide down once more. In twenty minutes it was gone again.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It was greatly cheering, though, to see that light. They found themselves stretching out those special polarizing membranes in their eyes, uncertain whether they'd need them or not.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Twenty-three hours later the sun was back, a little longer, a little higher. Just when the dark and cold and the monotonous climbing up and climbing down and then up again had grown oppressive and bleak and despairing, here came some warmth and light into the world. It must have been cheering and hopeful.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9450">
<span>How long did the search go on? Our probes are at the Pole of Relative Inaccessibility. We find no dry valley there, nothing that could be Terminus. Yet we know that the Migration must have begun there, in Terminus. We've found the remains of an AEF unit not far from Amundsen-Scott, the town at the South Pole itself. The bodies are perfectly preserved, so they clearly died before the Migration. We found another unit at Schmidt in the Malvold Nunataks beyond the Grove Mountains. Not the unit itself, but all its Intercorp equipment. The people were gone, so we assume they survived until the Migration, perhaps taken in by the people living there.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9451">
<span>Certainly they started at the Pole of Relative Inaccessibility and circled outward, unless Peter had some knowledge we do not. We know of what human beings called intuition, but how does intuition find a place in an unknown land? Peter's psi potential grew fairly high; we know that from his Edcomp records. Still, they must have searched a long time, he and the others. They would have been low on supplies by then.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>They were out of touch with the rest of Double-A as well. Why? Surely they could have communicated, yet we found nothing in Mt. Erebus to indicate anyone ever heard of Peter Devore or the others again. Of course, we are still sifting through the data, but first scans show no such evidence.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Nothing until the Migration. We understand much in this telling. We know how Peter got to Antarctica, how he met Mentor. We know why Regent Sable tried to stop them; we understand the AEF invasion. We know something of what Peter was doing back in Springfield, with Jimmy Radix and the others, and we mourn for Jimmy Radix now as we would not have then. We know something of the things Peter Devore studied, his strange martial arts, his meditation, the trial in the<i class="calibre2"> Agni</i>.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>But there are so many questions left. What was the Migration? Why did it happen the way it did? Where did they go? Did Peter find the Portal Mentor spoke about? What of the Anomaly?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>You see how it is. We cannot stop. I will not let them stop.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I imagine Peter and the others out there in that awful wasteland, never knowing when or if they will find what they seek. Only some built-in determination, almost like programming, could have kept them at it. Already Central Processing wants to call back our probes. Central Processing says we have limited resources.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Budgets. Always budgets. They worry, the others. I say we must keep looking or lose all. It has become our purpose to find out what happened, where the humans have gone. We cannot stop.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter did not stop. He went out there into the cold and dark, looking.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Should we do less?</span></p></div>
