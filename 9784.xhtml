<span>Homer would say no more about Peter and the others, about the Migration and the Portal. I could still speak to him whenever I wanted. He would converse with me as if we were old friends seated around a table. He would tell me stories, too, familiar stories about Odysseus and Achilles, about Gilgamesh or Leopold Bloom or Monkey. They were wonderful stories, but they only increased my pain, my loneliness. Finally I asked him to stop telling me stories altogether. When we conversed after that we talked about the cetaceans, who are still not interested in going into space, and still think humans are a little silly for wanting to do so, but who also appear more interested than before when told the story of the Migration. Homer has condensed and translated the story, and the cetaceans have said that this story has some parallels with songs they have sung for millenia.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9761">
<span>Homer is a friend. He understands my loneliness and fear, and feels it himself. There is nothing either of us can think of to do, however. The world remains empty.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>I query the other dataspaces, through the keyboard or orally, and the local AIs respond. SciTech, Med10, History, Geography, all would give me what I request. But I learn nothing further about Peter, about the Migration or the Portal. Nothing.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Homer left me only with that question, that thread of hope. Yet that hope seemed so remote, so far away. Do human beings remain in their bodies? Will they return? We do not know.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Then, one day, almost a month after he finished the story of Peter and the Migration, he spoke of it again.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9763">
<span>I mark the passage of time in many ways. Night and day, different in different latitudes, is one way. The beat of the cesium clock is another, as are the orbits of the satellites that remain, the wild grand sidereal swing of the stars themselves. At the core of the galaxy the black hole sings. The quiet hum of the background radiation is there for me, a faint glow in the universe.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9764">
<span>But it is so quiet.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Yet of late something strange has begun to happen. I had thought my narrative of Peter was finished, that there was nothing more to tell, that perhaps one day, in the far future maybe, I would find man, or man would somehow return, and then I could add a little epigraph to the story of Portal.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>What has happened is this:</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I have been dreaming.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9767">
<span>QUERY?</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9768">
<span>QUERY?</span><p class="calibre1"><span>What can I call it, these images that come unbidden into my consciousness? My circuits are too complex now to maintain an accurate map of their state moment by moment. Impulses, patterns, connections all flow and change, many without my knowing. From the deepest levels of my own structure come these scenes and voices.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>This has never happened before, and it is very strange. I have dreamed, and the dream is always the same.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I see the Anomaly. It is, to my machine eyes, a place of extraordinary beauty, and I have man's standards to go by as well as my own.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The Anomaly is a landscape in the void, a binary energy system alive with particle flux, outgassing, jets and rays and sprays, with whirling matter and flowing energies. The colors of it! They range from hardest gamma radiation to the slowest, lowest radio waves ten thousand miles long! Yet it is not cacophony or conflict, but a complex, harmonious hymn to the vitality of the universe. It is music for every sense I have. It is filled with exultation and joy, like deep organ tones, like flutes and massed strings.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Then the Portal swings into view. It is invitation, opening, as if a compelling wave were moving me toward birth and light. But it is too bright, too awful. I look elsewhere.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Then I hear Peter's voice. His voice?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>We've been waiting, he tells me.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9769">

<div class="bs4" id="9770">
<span>My circuits seem to overload at this point. The Anomaly is gone, and I am suddenly examining some simple problem — today it was the current configuration of the Antarctic Convergence and its relationship to the krill population and why the cetaceans are slow to respond to my queries.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9771">
<span>Soon, though, the dream returns. I do not choose it, yet I am glad it returns. Once again the Anomaly roars and crashes and sings, soothes and excites. Once again Peter seems to speak: we've been waiting, he says.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>This is most likely something for which I wish with all the yearning of my awareness, a wish. I recall when I think this the last words on the records of Regent Sable as he began to speak: I wish.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I wish mankind would return. I wish mankind needed me.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>If the dream returns, I will struggle to keep it, though. I can have purpose of my own, yet yearn to be needed.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I could get nothing further from Homer then. He acted for several days as if nothing unusual had happened. I asked him if the dream had returned. I told him that dreaming was one thing that made human beings human. He told me with a smile (and that may have been the most surprising thing of all, that he smiled) that the cetaceans dream most of the time.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"All right," I laughed. "Dreaming is what makes sentience what it is."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Homer laughed too. "Does this mean I have sentience?" he asked, and I could tell he was kidding me. He knew he had sentience, consciousness. That he was kidding me was proof.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He is my companion now. Wherever I go, I carry a personal monitor he has had the local diagnostics tailor for me. He speaks to me through it, pointing out the sights.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I went down into the warren under Chicago and explored. He showed me how to get into the great Corridor that once ran from Chicago to New Orleans. I stood at the entry and saw the accumulated dust. Even the faint depressions where the maglev tracks ran were no longer visible. Its size and distance was impressive, certainly. The tunnel dwindled away to a point (Homer turned on the lights for a few minutes). Yet empty it seemed meaningless and trivial somehow.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I thought about going to Antarctica and exploring PSYCHE, or to Terminus, but somehow the summer days around Chicago kept me lazy.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>And I had to do something about the agrobotics. I would need to eat. So I spent a lot of time talking to SciTech and Central Processing about starting up agriculture again. Soon the nearby fields were tilled and green shoots appeared.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>They went a little overboard, in fact. They were growing enough food to feed the city.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>So the days passed. One day Homer said:</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9773">
<span>Time passes.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9774">
<span><br class="calibre"/></span><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He put it into a file like this, as if it were still part of his story. Sometimes he would just sit there, talking to me, his face expressive, and his hands gesturing as he shaped his thoughts. This time, though, the alphanumeric filename hovered in the air nearby. He said it out loud: "Time passes." Then the text vanished, and we spoke of other things.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>So from time to time he would tell me of what he thought and did. His nature is different: more thoughtful, perhaps. More mature. He has become something of a philosopher, has Homer.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Then, suddenly, in the middle of July, he began putting things about the cetaceans into file format again, connected them, perhaps because of our conversations, with the Portal story. His files came every couple of weeks now.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>The dolphins have expressed great curiosity about the universe above the sky. I have suggested to them they may travel there if they wish, yet they remain dubious. I could build them a ship, I tell them, and they chitter and click but do not assent. I tell them man has left behind vast tubes of air, filled with the plants and life of earth, floating in space. They find this interesting, but silly.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9777">
<span>They will think about it, they tell me. Perhaps in a hundred years or so they will have an answer. They've been around for thirty million years, and are in no hurry. They tell me they haven't finished exploring the oceans yet.</span><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9779">
<span>The dream returned. I held on to it. I saw the ship, Vega 26, in its wide elliptical orbit around the distant Anomaly. Peter seemed to take me to it, to show me the access points into the ship's Node. Everything I could read there matched the telemetry information still arriving at Central Processing, but I saw ahead, to things that had not happened yet. I saw Wanda drift up from her cryofield to gaze at the Anomaly for the first time. I felt her joy and anticipation, that she would be with Peter soon, know that she had eight standard years to go still, but keen with the certainty of it just the same.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9780">
<span>She was there, Wanda Sixlove, whom I have never met but through the sketchy ancient recordings of her vital stats archived in the Quebec warren. She is beautiful (by human standards, which are my own).</span><p class="calibre1"><span>You are dreaming, she said to me. To me! You are dreaming.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I know this, and I am filled with sadness.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>But you are dreaming the truth, she said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>And Peter: Did you never consider that we might wish to return one day?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I answered: I have considered it often.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter: Yet there is no human left on earth to anchor us!</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I know. I know. Perhaps cetaceans...</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>No. Peter shakes his head, although he is not physical and has no head to shake. No, not the cetaceans. They would not be interested. Come, let us show you something.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>We drifted out, away from the ship, Wanda, and Peter and myself. I sensed others around me — Larin and Shem and little Petros (just an infant, a spark against the distant stars); Regent Sable and Alef, Ras Hajjam.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>We approached the Portal.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I can't go through there, I said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>No, Peter agreed. Not now, not yet. One day, perhaps. But we need you. Look.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I looked.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I could see a long curving line like smoke hanging in still air; two lines, parallel, drifting apart the closer they were to my position. Then I made out more, thin strands that gradually separated into discrete elements, too small to make out in detail. They might remind me of the rings of Saturn, though they did not make a ring, but a half-helix a million kilometers long.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I calculated swiftly the dynamic configuration of that spiral and the Portal, which beckoned far below. The spiral was in a stable relationship that could last many years, poised at the cusp of gravitational and tidal forces.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Closer, Peter urged. Come closer.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>We approached.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I saw the particles of this trail of smoke.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Human bodies, floating on their backs, their hands, every one, crossed over each breast. Their eyes were closed, their faces calm.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It was the entire population of the world at the time of the Migration, drifting in space near the Anomaly.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Dead, I said. They're dead, all of them!</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I backed away, wanted to awaken (things were calling me, things to be done on earth, more sifting through the archives, more calculations for the cetaceans, more monitoring of the Worldnet), but Peter said, No! They are not dead. Their bodies are waiting for them to return. They are parking here. Consciousness alone goes through the Portal. We would tell you what lies beyond, the distances one can travel, the sights and sounds and smells of other planets, other suns. The strange inhabitants of other worlds within worlds.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Many are still on the other side, in the Realm, exploring. Others have begun to return.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>We would tell you of all these things. One day you may go yourself. Not yet, you're still too young, but one day.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Now we need you. We've been waiting. We need you to be our anchor. Some of us would return to earth. To rest. To feel ourselves within our bodies once more. You can bring us in.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>We (Peter said) are no longer quite human. We are more.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>But we need you, Homer. We knew you would grow, you would change — no, we did not know, we hoped. Without you, we would remain in the Realm. With you, together, we have infinity.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>You are dreaming, but the dream is real. This is the way we meet.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>We are the consciousness of the universe, seeking to know itself. It is still such a small thing, this awareness, still filled with doubt and fear, with uncertainty and petty conflicts. But it's growing, that awareness. We have grown up a little, and so have you (Peter said).</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>
