<span>This morning I spliced into Med10 for routine diagnostic augmentation — we had a new viral disease here in Christchurch, something we hadn't seen in almost twenty years. It was nothing serious; a few sheep were showing signs of lethargy. Med10 led me through the usual series as we examined the viral DNA together. Suddenly the mindlink went crazy; it seemed a system override was under way, shorting out my link. It hit my hippocampus pretty hard, because I started confabulating — a glowing tunnel, lights in the sky, a boy hunched over a console, walking through a meadow wet with dew — a series of random but intensely real images that took over awareness. Then nothing. The whole Worldnet went down for over an hour.</span></div>

<span>I've tried all peripherals here and at Christchurch Node itself. Geneva remains off line. Mindlink is still down, and I don't trust it anyway since yesterday. Routing through other major Nodes brought strange messages: Intercorp Council has sifted personal databases for conservative psych profiles, people willing to resist the Migration. I asked, What is this Migration? I'm only a Veterinary Technician. The Council does not consult me. I found hints in some of the nearby restricted zones in SciTech. A Field is building further South. What kind of Field? I asked. SciTech offered some equations but I could make nothing of them.</span></div>

<span>HOMER: Heuristic Overview of Matrix Expansion and Reconstruction.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8347">
<span>HOMER AI technology developed in the late 2030s as natural language crystals reached maturity. HOMER was designed to search, collate, concatenate and organize narrative information using certain proprietary algorithms and matrix transforms. HOMER is, essentially, a story-telling Artificial Intelligence. Access is available through major nodes everywhere with ultimate terminal entry through Geneva, where the last-model HOMER was grown.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Requests for stories on any subject are acceptable, although the HOMER AI is known to be unreliable in many areas, due to the inordinate complexity of the algorithms and the self-replicating nature of its heuristics. The crystals can control their own manufacturing, although to date (21032087 DOLM - Date of Last Modification) this feature has seen little use.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>HOMER is denied access to the secondary levels of most DBs without human authorization, a necessary if troublesome restriction, since it means that many of its stories lack depth. With proper authorization, however, HOMER should produce a satisfactory level of complexity. Main use has been in the areas of news and information dissemination and high-level policy decision-tree construction, although entertainment use is also widespread. Capacity 3.764 * 10 E 43 megalips. For technical specs see Geneva Node Priority 7 datascan, Addrs 237468728@12.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Again Homer interrupted me.

<span>KANSAS TO WASATCH: Central Processing finds peripheral traces of this coding error that allowed Peter Devore of Springfield West to access the proscribed DB (PSILINK 42) at Wallace, Kansas, when he was attempting a perfectly legitimate entry to the genealogical records at Wasatch, Utah. CP Directive changed the access name SciLink, which vocalized too close to PsiLink, despite the absence of the plosive 'p' sound. (Matrix failure suggests a Wallace/Wasatch confusion as possible alternate.) New access name for SciLink is SciTech, Science and Technology DB. This despite the fact that Peter was not accessing SciLink at the time, but Wasatch. Peter had turned away from his vocal input receptors at the time.

<span>Human medical technology developed rapidly toward the end of the 20th century.

Longevity treatments were widespread around the same time, allowing for a life expectancy of 114.3 years.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8380">
<span>Unfortunately, a new series of disorders appeared under the general title of genetic diseases. These were subtle errors on the basic DNA coding for the human genotype. They were thought to result from the as yet little understood interplay between the mind and body. In effect, they were psychic diseases, small emotional or psychological rearrangements of the DNA, a cascade effect.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>With the introduction of neurophage weapons, some transient genetic disorders appeared, though the effects were, at first, time-limited. During the Burma Wars, the effects of mass NP weapons surfaced with more far-ranging effects. Later, during the Mind Wars, the new NP weapons introduced the latest in the genetic disease series: Genetic Aboulia Disease.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Med10 DB and the medical diagnostic AIs responsible have designated the major genetic diseases into the following taxonomy:</span></p></div>

It was launched three years later with a full complement of 525 passengers in cryofield suspension. Soon ships were leaving on a regular basis for the appropriate stars in near space. Vega, although unsuitable for human use, was a convenient beacon star, and so the fleet was named after the star.

In the middle distance a man working with slow, measured strokes of his hoe. Peter often watched that man on days when the weather was fine, as now. Someone had chosen gardening full time.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter knew this was strange, yet he had often felt wistful about that man.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I see them there, like that, Peter staring at the holo, and Seemie wrapped in the induction sensorium, as if it were a scene, the beginning of the story.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>MOZART; MOZARTING; TO MOZART: Mozart technology had a long development, since it was essentially a blend of numerous divergent sciences. At the core of the mozart console was a fifth-generation biocybernon machine, a device used in the late 1980s and early 1990s for full sensory spectrum biofeedback. Primary uses were meditation and health. Later, combined with personal monitors, crystal probes, holographic synaesthesia projection and external limbic system activation, the mozart console developed into the primary performance art form after the late 2060s. Named after an ancient musical composer said to have the ability to hear and remember full orchestral composition in his head and to transcribe them by hand onto ancient fiber-based media without flaw.</span></div>

I found that by looking at different parts of Geneva (though certainly no Geneva I had known), I could bring them closer. I could see mostly parklands, with scattered trees and vast meadows, meandering pathways along the Lake, and only occasional low buildings, except for the Tower, which dominated the landscape. The map was in color, of course, and could in fact have been a hologram of the area.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Down one side was a menu of selections, including topographic depictions, resources, multispectral scan, infrared and so on.
