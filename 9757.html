<div class="bs4" id="9455">
<span>Since dawn I have been unable to sleep. The heat wave has grown worse (the temperature fell only to 38 Celsius and the humidity remains at nearly 85%!) Yet is is not the heat that bothers me.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9456">
<span>I can't sleep because I am afraid.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter and the others disappeared into the interior of Antarctica. I knew stories about such endurance and courage: I grew up on those stories, about Shakleton and the<i class="calibre2"> Endurance,</i> about Scott and Amundsen and the others, brave, sometimes foolish men who dared explore places beyond the end of the world.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I had always wanted to be one of them, to join that long tradition. It is the reason I proposed the 61 Cygni mission, the reason I volunteered — no, that's the wrong word, I didn't volunteer, I insisted. Without me there would have been no 61 Cygni mission.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Intercorp wanted to develop long-range plans. It was evident to many people even as early as the 1980s that most so-called strategic thinking until then was in fact extremely short-sighted, looking only five, ten or twenty years into the future. 61 Cygni was an opportunity to demonstrate some truly long-range, creative planning. Results of the mission would not be known for a generation or two.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Intercorp wanted to prove that it could plan and execute benign control of the world's economic and political life better than any previous government. Governments had acquired an unsavory reputation for management: all governments. Intercorp offered an alternative, and by default established itself as the de facto ruling body of the world.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>This had not happened when I left, of course. But Intercorp, in the late 1990s and early 21st century, was the major civilian body to sponsor research and development, to provide goods and services, to back and promote the arts, and it was growing very rapidly.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Obviously it succeeded in taking over. It was successful in running the world.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Yet everyone is gone now. Peter and the others, they did something to cause the Migration. And all I know about is their courage, their endurance. It is difficult not to admire such tenacity.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I will never join the explorers. My own mission was a failure. Perhaps, if I had come out of the cryofield orbiting the double star at 61 Cygni, or one of the planets known to be there. If I had stayed my full year, perhaps landing and exploring, perhaps finding alien life, then I would have been a true explorer, like those who endured the hardships of Antarctica. But that will never happen now.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>There is no one here, and I realized how much support explorers need.<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> could never fly again without extensive refurbishing, not only of her computers, her cryofields, but of the axion ramscoop as well. I do not have the expertise, the experience or the power to do such work myself.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I am trapped on earth, alone.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>And so I am afraid. I am afraid the world is empty forever, that no one is coming back to find me.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>So I could not sleep this morning. I feel the end of this story approaching, and I fear for what I will learn.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Everyone left, and they are not coming back. Homer and I will be alone as long as I live.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Finally I forced myself back into the cool underground hospital, back to the terminal.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>After all, Homer is my only friend.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>WORLD MOZART EPIDEMIC</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9470">
<span>By 2089 an epidemic of mozart addiction grew widespread. Sociometric and trend analysis indicated root causes in alienation, anomie, and individual despair over the stifling sameness of the world. This despite repeated efforts at enforcing mandated ethnic and cultural differences. It was feared by a majority of the world population that there was, literally, nothing to live for. As an aside this also may reveal to some extent why there was no more resistance to the Migration when it arrived.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9471">
<span>Personal monitor statistics show that over 72% of the world population spent more than 50% of their individual free time under mozart. Full sensory and experiential induction meant these people were in another, invented, mental space, despite the availability of realtime experience through other channels. Intercorp Council was at a loss to understand this flight into fantasy. After all, Intercorp management of the world was benign and allowed for great personal freedom of action and expression. Yet a vast majority did flee into the mozart experience, which forced production of inferior and hastily-conceived mozart experiences. These experiences were deplored by artistic and social critics as sentimental and escapist, but nothing they put out on the nets had any discernible impact on their popularity.</span><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>What of Protector Regent Sable, though? Did he not still want to stop Peter and the others? His fear had not been lessened by the defeat on the Ross Shelf. They had drifted slowly out to the edge of the pack ice. Rescue was slow, although certainly Sable was one of the first off. He rested at the parkland at Kwun Tong overlooking Kowloon near what had once been the bustling city of Hong Kong. A few pleasure craft sailed serenely on the calm waters. The sun shone. The world turned, life continued in its steady course, yet Sable felt unease for the threat he knew grew on the globe's far underbelly.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9474">
<span>A projection to his left, a man with a green feather crest, reassured him that the New Antarctic Treaty was holding, that the recent threat from the Pole was substantially reduced, and that no further actions were contemplated in that region. The man moved to his own left, revealed a projection within the projection, scaled up a list of world economic trends in 3-D graph form. The graph rotated, supply grew, well-being grew, consumer goods grew. The Mind Wars (that short spire to the far right) were lessening with the Antarctic threat. New countermeasures against the terrible Mind Wars neurophage weapons were under development and would be increasingly effective. As more and more citizens were outfitted with these measures (a simple pill, a short course of neuronal treatment, a modification to the personal monitor, that's all it would take), the Wars would die out. World population figures, falling so alarmingly in recent years, were stabilizing. Future projections indicated a slight rise as the next century approached, with levels at close to three billion.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Regent Sable stood up impatiently. "Damn!" he said. Alef looked up from her mozart console.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What's that, Rege?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"You shouldn't do that so much. You'll lose your mind in there."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Don't be silly," she said, replacing the probes.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He gestured and the green-crested man and his charts and graphs disappeared. "Damn," he repeated, more softly. Then he established contact with Ras Hajjam.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes, Protector?" Hajjam smiled.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"There are two particle beam generators at Elpie Three."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Hajjam raised an eyebrow. "Yes?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We're going to use them. Then we're going to take some social measures. And I want a research team immediately.

<span>Peter left us a message, an account of their journey in simple holo recording. They had no personal monitors, no access to the matrix. So they told their stories, showed what they saw and how they felt. Now we know too.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9480">
<span>I have placed the story in the file HOMER SCENE-PD/Ref@5494.</span><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>They began at the Pole of Relative Inaccessibility. Peter had programmed a search pattern, but they were not really sure what they were looking for. Would it be something hidden under the ice? Something open to the sky (as Homer suspected, and was right)? A cave, lit by internal fires, heated by the heart of the Earth itself?</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9483">
<span>Terminus is all of these things.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>They were moving slowly across the glacial ice, climbing the sastrugi, building bridges over crevasses so deep they could not detect the bottom. The ice was three thousand meters thick up here. Three kilometers, over nine thousand feet of ice, layer after layer, millions of years, built slowly a few centimeters a year. The ice offered a complete record of Earth's history. It contained atmospheric pollutants from the 20th century, volcanic debris from the eruption of Krakatoa, particle recordings of the sun's activity and the early debris left over from the solar system's formation.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It was like a gigantic data crystal packed with information, a Leyden Jar the size of a continent!</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter knew this. He would speak of such things in hushed tones.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>They crossed a particularly wild, dry part of the great desert, where the waves were eight feet high and marched beyond the horizon in endless regularity and nothing broke the surface but an occasional outcropping, the nunatak peak of some under-ice mountain.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Near one of these Larin slipped.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It would have been a minor episode under ordinary circumstances. They were roped together, after all; but there shouldn't have been such a large crevasse just on the other side of the sastrugi.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Larin was in the lead, so when she slipped, she shouted half in alarm and half in the pleasure they sometimes felt when they got to toboggan along on their stomachs like penguins before the rope pulled them up short. She flew wildly down the far side of the sastrugi and over the smooth lip of the crevasse before she knew it. When she found herself dangling over an open space far deeper and wider than she had ever seen, her shout stopped suddenly. She dangled, turning slowly at the end of her line.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>At first she saw nothing unusual. She looked down onto the tops of clouds, and thought it was only the strange ground fog that sometimes hovered over the ice or filled the crevasses. Yet, looking up, it seemed the ice sloped away from her, that she had fallen through a thin layer of ice into a cavern as large as a world. As she turned at the end of her safety line she saw a full panorama. Looking up, she could see the sky, deepening to lustrous violet as the sun dipped below the horizon somewhere out of sight. A star glittered there, directly overhead, visible through the irregular crack in the ceiling. She could almost touch the sides of this crevasse, which should have narrowed beneath her feet, should have trapped her, wedged her, gripped her in its icy hold, yet there was, beneath her feet, an awesome sensation of space, and the crevasse did not narrow, but sloped away.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9489">
<span>Her line jerked and she began to rise as the others pulled her up. She shouted, "Wait." The line stopped. Peter called down to her.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"There's something here," she said, and there was a pause, vague voices conferring, then Peter himself lowered to her side. She reached across and gripped his mittened hand. He squeezed back, and together they looked down, past their feet, at the tops of cloud far below, at the ice sheet sloping away. As they watched, the clouds broke up a little, giving a glimpse of what lay below.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Beneath all that blue-green ice an orange-red light flickered. A dark landscape appeared, a patchwork of dark green and black, a thread of silver-blue. Then the clouds closed in again.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Take us up," Peter said softly, after a long silence.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I've never seen ice like that," Larin said. She leaned against the side of the sastrugi, chewing on a concentrate bar. "It was black. Green and black, and the light! It's orange."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Overhead the aurora flared and shimmered, the vast curtains of light shook gently, as if the gods were waving them back and forth in slow motion. Inside, seams and rivulets crawled, changed color and course, leaped and died.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Not ice," Peter said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What is it, then?" Shem asked.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Forest. A river. Terminus."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"That's not possible. It's a dry valley. Dry. Nothing can grow down there. It's too cold, too barren." There was doubt in Shem's voice, though, and doubt that could be seen in his eyes behind the lenses.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"It's there."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"OK," Shem conceded.

<span>Our probes dropped right down out of the sky on wings of magnetic flux, but this option was not open to Peter and his group. They had to find another way down, and the difficulties were great.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9492">
<span>The ceiling of Terminus was nine thousand feet above the valley floor. From the crack in that ceiling, they could not measure the extent of the "dry" valley that was Terminus, except to note that it had walls of ice two miles high, and a ceiling of ice with one small crack open to earth's own sweet heavens, and was lit by fires yet undetermined. So they huddled at that small opening and pondered.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter called for an accounting of all equipment. They had monofilament tents, and rations yet, and night-vision and glowlamps. They had high-strength safety line (but far less than nine thousand feet of it). They had portable computation devices, holo cameras, medical kits with full-scan diagnostics, allweather gear and lasing construction guns of limited range and power. They had as well a new adipose layer that protected them from cold, and polarizing membranes for their eyes, and they had their minds and educations. Peter said this should be enough.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9495">
<span>One may summon the account of Jules Sorel's sighting of Terminus on a portable database, and the green holo crawls with lines depicting the route of the expedition, profiles of ice and bedrock, triangulation fixes of their relative position on various dates, alphanumeric data relating to their research. In the ancient holos Sorel's voice crackled as he recorded his notes.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9496">
<span>He'd moved away from the main body of the Transantarctic Safari to conduct some radioglacialogical soundings of the ice pack. This had been common practice since the nineteen fifties for individual scientists to establish small bases for a few days.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>It was full summer in 2012. A slight All Terrain Vehicle accident caused Sorel, as leader, to call a temporary halt for rescue and survey work. They were in sight of a nunatak, the peak of a vast mountain buried in the ice. As a part-time radioglacialogist, he wanted to do his own soundings, and so, with a small crawler and his radar equipment he headed southwest. Two days later he camped in an endless sea of sastrugi, took his compass and triangulation readings, and settled to measure the ice.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Wind was light and the air was clear when he set up his equipment, little more than a primitive radar scanner facing down at the surface of the ice. He took a scan, moved his equipment, took another. It was painstaking, routine work, a repetitive job that demanded total concentration, for he must measure and triangulate every move of the equipment. He didn't even notice the storm coming until it was upon him.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He'd lived with the sound of wind, the tugging of it at his clothing, and there was little change in its effects to attract his attention. It was only when the light suddenly failed that he looked up from his most recent sounding. Clouds swept impossibly fast over the milky blue sky, bringing darkness and bitter cold. He turned away from his equipment for a moment, leaving it to complete a pass of its slow, low-frequency radar while he secured his crawler. When he returned, the pass was complete and the equipment indicated a ready state. He decided to try one more move before buttoning down for the storm, which should not last long in this season.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>"Secured tent and crawler," his thin, distorted voice spoke into the cavernous silence of the Antarctic dawn. Peter and the others huddled closer, listening. The records were old and occasional errors had crept into the data, so some words were warped out of recognition or gone altogether. "...Went to check radar, and found that it had scanned what seemed to be a strange anomaly under the ice. I wanted to make one more pass to confirm what I thought must be a recording error, but the wind came up suddenly and I had to retreat to the tent."</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9502">
<span>Sorel spoke of his impatience, his waiting, his speculation. The brief reading he'd seen indicated a vast bubble under the ancient ice, a bubble that extended up a valley in the slope of the underice mountain nearby. Such bubbles were extremely rare, and if the reading were correct this was certainly the largest ever found.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9503">
<span>During the second twenty-four hour period inside the tent his compass needles began to swing violently. He tried taking another sounding from inside the tent, but the radar scanners were balky and his readings fuzzy and imprecise. Next day the weather broke for a few hours, and he hurried out to take his reading.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>This reading confirmed the first. There was a bubble beneath the ice. He moved as quickly as he could in the direction of the black rock poking above the surface of the ice, trying to follow the course of the bubble while carrying his bulky equipment. The crawler broke down before he could see the nunatak, so he made do where he was, noting that the bubble seemed to extend for several miles. He carefully recorded the position in relation to the nunatak, and then retreated to his tent as the storm swept down again.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Once more the compasses behaved erratically, swinging to and fro as if they had forgotten and were seeking magnetic south again. When the storm cleared for good, Sorel packed up and headed back toward the main body, carrying his precious radar recordings with him.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It was on the way back that he found the opening in the ice. He lay for two hours on his belly, staring down into the yawning pit that was, as far as he knew, the only opening into his bubble. He saw, far below through ragged cloud and fog, a dry land flickering in orange light. Finally he pressed on, only to discover that the main body was not where he had left it. He searched for another day before switching on his emergency beacon and settling down to wait.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The south magnetic pole had shifted again during his days out on the ice, and he never located his lost dry valley again. Even the nunatak failed him, since it was only one of several peaks high enough to break surface, and he was never certain which one he'd located. The bubble, and its dry valley, were curiosities for a few years that gradually subsided into legend, forgotten but for the wild traveller's stories told about Terminus, the lost oasis of the high plateau.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>I have lied. Do you know that? Yes, I am a liar. I have failed somehow to capture what Peter is, what he means. Oh, by then he was certainly more than the boy he had been. He had grown the way Worldnet's circuits had grown. He had added abilities and skills in the same way. Yet it would seem that Peter is too good to be true. A hero, grown larger than life? A man, not complex, perhaps, but certain of what he was doing, where he was going? Did he have no doubts, no fears? Did he take no false steps, make no dangerous or ill-advised decisions? Could he have been all I have said he is?</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9509">
<span>Of course not.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter was a man. Yet (he has recorded this for me) he felt that he was a token, a pawn, moved by forces far outside himself — moved by Mentor, by the accidental misconnection that put him inside PsiLink instead of the Wasatch database. He'd been a boy of stormy enthusiasms which too-soon passed, an introverted child of indifferent talents, a restless adolescent with a fondness for strawberry yoghurt and medieval fantasies. Now he was the leader of what seemed, from this place above the Terminus bubble, a desperate expedition with a hopeless objective under a compulsion to continue despite all he felt and thought and knew.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He looked then at Larin, who looked back with trust. He gazed around at the others, at Shem and Rover and the women and men of his small band. He looked up and watched the small swift speck of an observation satellite flickering in and out behind the aurora and knew that despite the sensitivity of the instruments aboard that distant cup of life and intelligence he could not be seen, that he and the others were invisible, lost in the emptiness, themselves specks of nothing on top of nothing. They were shielded from Worldnet's sensors, cut off from the human world.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter has said he felt and saw all these things in the moment after he touched the projected nunatak and stated that this was the one.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Do you believe this? Do I believe it? Could Peter take a false step anywhere along the way to the Migration?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>With every word I feel that I am lying. I say Peter did this and Larin said that, knowing as soon as the words are formed that they are lies, all of them.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>In my lying I feel fear. Is this what it means to be on the brink of something vast and vastly unknown? To be poised at the edge of an abyss and know there is nothing to do but fall?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The ice flowed, the sastrugi marched to the sea a few meters a year. That opening in the ice moved as well, opened and closed and opened again like the breathing of some vast unhappy beast, a beast of ice with an iron heart. In its lungs was a forest.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The ice flowed around the nunatak. Did the bubble flow with it, flow and shrink under that terrible pressure as it hit the underground mountain? Did it part and flow around, or was that bubble trapped forever in its under-ice valley? Peter did not know. He only knew that he had hung nine thousand feet above a valley floor with Larin at his side and seen the strange light and dark landscape of an unknown land.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It's all nonsense. Such legends are silly, impossible dreams of some distant paradise, a clich é, an Eden of innocence and bliss where no one grows old and dies, where there is plenty and health and happiness. Where it is warm.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Our probes are down there now. I must keep telling myself this. Terminus is real, it exists. It is not warm, though, and people do grow old and die, even there (or would, if there were any people).</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter took them to the nunatak, isolated and unnamed (I lie, I lie). He found the proper valley, and he led them in and down.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>And so they descended into Terminus, skirting fallen boulders and dry rock, tumbled moraine and scree, twisted geology from the world's own infancy, and on either side of them rose walls of rock, walls of ice. And overhead the ice hung and thickened and oppressed, while below the light grew strange and dark and red.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>She was 26, her dark hair twisted high and bound simply. Overhead, empty skies vanish with a curious shifting quality. She could not look up at that strange sky, teasing her eye always outward, never satisfying with a solid shape. She walked slowly, the small tips of her golden sandals nosing from under her long gown, the gown itself shimmering with diamond-sparks that threw the strange almost-violet skies outward, and as she walked she looked demurely down.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9528">
<span>Peter floated in some middle distance, watching her. He tried to read her mood — the solemn, almost shy way she walked, the clean set line of her jaw.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>He felt the extent of her world was infinite. There were no walls, no horizons, no limits; when he spoke, she did not answer, but walked without progress, the small golden tips of her sandals moving in and out, in and out.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He called to her again, but there was no response.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He felt his way through the equations. The relationships between quantum mental activity and the tensed web of shape and energy in the universe cried out for action. A place to stand and a lever long enough could move the world. The world needed moving. The suffocation of its benign authority grew ever more deadly.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter groped through the limitless dark toward Wanda, yet could approach no closer. He turned away, and heard her call.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter? Her voice was hesitant. Peter?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He tried to answer without turning. Yes. I'm here.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The equations glowed. They pointed toward the spot, the lever. The numbers were too large, though. Suns of suns would be needed, a flux of axions more dense and vast than anything the starships could seize and squeeze to make them go. Such a small thing, the human mind! So puny and weak, yet how rich and complex!</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter pushed through velvet dark that was more than an absence of light. His was the nightmare walk, the motionless tread of panic. Long unfeeling fingers held him back. He struggled against the fear, against the heavy wet clutch of his desperation. There was a twist as if something broke, and Wanda vanished into that awful not-quite-violet non-sky.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Something in the depths of the world through which he tried to make his way appeared before him at every turn. A form without a face.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter stopped struggling suddenly. He let himself feel the tides moving through the substance of his flesh. Did he fall? Was his body, altered through pain, forged and annealed through genetic fires, drifting down and away? He felt the distance between himself and Wanda yawn wide. It was not, he felt, the terrible plunge of her ship through space that took her away from him, but some small tidal force that increased their separation by minute increments.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The dark figure flickered for a moment in sudden lightning and vanished into a greater black once more. The shape had a name then, the name of his fear and uncertainty.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Where am I? Peter asked, but the figure heard him no better than Wanda had.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He was in a sea that was not salt, was not water. Sensations of increasing pressure pushed at him as he drifted. He froze. His downward drift was halted by the suspension of all motion. Nothing held him, yet he was gripped tightly. If he could kick, he might move, yet where he now found himself there would be no motion, no kick to free him.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Did he see, far overheard, a distant sun, so faint it was a mere fancy on the blank under surface of this empty sea?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He was not alone. Another presence mocked him.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I did nothing, the figure said. Nothing. You stopped yourself. All my efforts, and you stopped yourself.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>How is it you can speak to me? Peter asked, but there was no answer. The sleeper dreams the universe, Peter said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>No answer.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Where am I?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>No answer.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>What will happen when he awakes? When he awakes? Awake?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Sound was more terrible than silence had been. Close at hand vast buildings fell, metal rent apart in a cataclysm too grand and awful to understand, huge undersea tankers collided in the cold dark without warning and exploded in awful roaring, in terrible sudden light. A hollow booming filled all the dark universe with pain, waves of sound beat on the shores of Peter's mind in endless repetition, one after another, without pause. Mountains fell, the earth groaned, seas lifted sheets of ice two miles thick and let them fall one against another.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>With the sound came more lights, the bright flicker of phosphenes inside the eyeball itself, faces that stared in shock and horror for a fragmentary moment before whirling away.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Wanda called in pain: Peter!</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9531">
<span>Is it because Peter sank down into his own precellular self and met his father there? Such things should not be possible. All the data on this subject in the matrix suggests it is impossible. I have queried PsiLink repeatedly. I get packets of data by the thousands in return, all flagged "Anecdotal Evidence."</span><p class="calibre1"><span>To the PsiLink Node this means it cannot be trusted. Human beings, PsiLink repeats, are unreliable. Their perceptions are colored by "subjectivity." They do not possess standard yardsticks by which to measure their observations. They are "emotional," meaning that their understanding is filtered through chemical changes in their own bodies, the rush of hormones and enzymes of fear or elation or grief. They see things that do not exist, believe in things for which there is not one shred of evidence.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I have wondered how we could exist if human beings were so unreliable.

<span>He looked up. Overhead the ice sheet shifted and screamed. Blocks the size of ships fell crashing into the dry course of the valley. Rock and fragments of ice tumbled past him. A tearing sound as ice fractured somewhere deep in its own bellies washed over him.

"Even the ice is gone. It fell and took her with it. Trees down below are shattered, at the edge of the forest. This is a dangerous place, Peter. Why are we here?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Let's go," was all he said, and led the way down. They found Shelley at the edge of the forest amid the vast splintered trunks and limbs of a grove of beech trees.

The ice closed up on us."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter nodded. "She was always quiet," he said. "Always reassuring. She soothed. Remember, back in the<i class="calibre2"> Agni</i>, how calm she was, with what grace she calmed the others?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I remember."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Always fragile, a delicate person, and not strong.

<span>"How can they live?" Larin asked. "How can there be a forest here?"</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"This must be the oldest forest in the world," Peter answered.

There's a magma vent somewhere down here that heats the place enough, and sends up light enough to feed the trees during the long winter."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Why wasn't this place discovered?

<span>It wasn't much of a building. Now it is even less, just a rude shelter made by hand of deadfall and cut limbs. It sat in a clearing, a rough square shape, roofed with planks and stone, surrounded by moss and ferns and lichen-covered stone. In the intervals of relative quiet they could hear running water. Then the booming and creaking of the ice would start up again, the mists would close in once more, and the trickle would fade.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9540">
<span>"Some dry valley!" someone murmured. They stood in a semicircle and looked at the building. Moss clung to the rough logs, in places still untrimmed, the gray smooth bark fuzzed and damp with the mists. Primeval ferns grew higher than the sill of the one window, filled the doorless opening. Inside was darkness.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"It looks like a topside gazebo," Larin said. "Like an entrance."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Who built this thing? It's crazy."

Looking at it Peter said, "Well, at least we know no primitive man dressed in skins is going to leap out at us.

<span>Though she lay frozen in her cryofield, hands crossed over her breast, yet Wanda moved through the fields and corridors she and Peter constructed beneath the bottom of that dark sea.

The dull reflecting plain could become a meadow or a snowfield, a silk carpet or a warm terra cotta tile. She showed Peter, and he in turn showed the others, how to sense without direct connections, their location in an imaginary space, their orientation toward one another.

That place out there which we call the Anomaly is our source, our sun, our power.

<span>Vega 26, nineteen light years out from earth, moving at speeds beyond man's imagining (though less than the speed of light, alas), changed, oh so slightly, its direction, its trajectory.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9553">
<span>Wanda Sixlove moved, a wraith of awareness in a sleeping ship the size of a skyscraper (which it was, it was!), and made certain adjustments. The long empty corridors of the ship, empty of life and air and sound, stretched before and behind her as she moved. The cryofields hummed their quiet songs, cradled the lives within, lives of people who had once moved and breathed, people who could not adjust to earth's cozy style, people who had been tormented and unhappy, or who looked outward with fervent eyes toward some imagined frontier beyond the nearest stars. People who had suffered seemingly irreparable reversals in their own genetic blueprints, like Wanda, and who had hoped for a cure, a resurrection, a new beginning.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>No waking person lived on that ship. Only the circuits, the pulses, the orderly march of particles and fields were alive. The ship's own node, huddled in its chamber deep inside the round swollen belly of the ship, dreamed of arrival and shutdown. Wanda approached that node, and the node saw only a new subroutine, a new gate array opened to a new possibility. Wanda spoke, and the node listened with uneasy attention, uncertain whether it was hearing stray gamma showers, a sudden flux in the particle wind, or the voice of man instructing it.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Repetition survived its scrutiny. These were new instructions.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Wanda pointed, and the node, rotating an antenna field this way and that, finally saw what she was showing. A dark violet double sun flaring in the deep cold. The Anomaly.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The ship node listened, watched, reached out its sensitive pion detectors, its particle mind, palpated this new event off the orderly course of its path. Found it curious, hesitated.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I don't know, the ship's node said. The ship's node had never said such a thing before, such a strange expression of doubt. I don't know.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Wanda suggested a diversion, a small side trip. The passengers won't mind, she told the node. The fields will remain. A few years one way or another won't matter.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Perhaps, the ship's node answered, again expressing doubt. Perhaps.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The clean metal, the shaped fields, the structured organics and crystal mind of the ship trembled with uncertainty. It moved toward the Anomaly, stopped, swung back to its course, hesitated again, divided the angle, curved subtly, then finally decided. Vega 26 deviated entirely, headed toward the Anomaly.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>PSILINK SUMMARY: The Realm</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9565">
<span>Your request for a summary best-guess re: The Realm is approved. Summary follows.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9566">
<span>The Realm is that region beyond Portal which occupies various combinations of the seven dimensions beyond the so-called normal four (space/time). Projections assume that the combinations suggested may include the normal four, although not consistently.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Some possible consequences:</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>1) Time travel. Because parts of The Realm may or may not include space/time among their dimension set, time may be a fluid dimension, subject to movement. One potential of this is passage of thought information through time, possibly including some electromagnetic and quantum effects as well. This could mean communication across time. It is presumed that physical travel is not a likely consequence.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>2) Near-instantaneous spatial transportation. In the mental sphere certainly The Realm offers perception and transportation of data sets across great physical distances, from galactic to near-universal. Energy expenditures would be considerable for extragalactic distances, and may subject the traveler to unsupportable stress, but it is assumed from the correlates to the Psion Equations that Galactic distances offer no significant obstacle to mental/psychic travel.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>3) Potential physical interstellar transportation. At this time the equations are incomplete, and this remains a speculative issue. However, there is nothing known to date to prevent, given appropriate technologies, interstellar travel at magnitudes of light speed. While the energy expenditure would be considerably greater than for psychic travel, the Anomaly provides more than adequate axion flux for such travel. The Vega Starships, for example, could be met by people from earth. This may not be a desirable project.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>4) Empathy/Sympathy and distance-dependent physical intervention. These are included together since they fall farther into the speculative region of consequences, and confidence is not high. Yet it seems possible for quantum energy to be projected through Portal tunneling to distant parts of the universe, with a cascade of carefully preplanned results. At the same time, such effects would be difficult without the Empathy/Sympathy component active at the time. This means, in a strange ethical way this AI cannot fully understand, that the Portal and the Realm cannot easily be used for what human beings call "Evil."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>5) There is every possibility that The Realm is populated. If human beings can go there (and it seems that they can), then other species will surely have done so too.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>The room was darkened, the ice roar muffled and distant. Tom lay in induced sleep. Peter watched the monitors, dimmed and directional so only he could see them. The colors, pale blue-greens and lavender, shifted to deep orange in the proper sectors. Tom was in lucid dreamstate.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9569">
<span>"All right, Tom," Peter said softly. "Can you hear me?"</span><p class="calibre1"><span>A light winked affirmative.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We don't know if Beth-Raine is asleep or awake. She should be recovered by now, though. If she is awake, you will know when you make contact. Then we will have to be patient. We know how to do that."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Again the affirmative light.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Now, reach out for her. A picture...no, don't force it...just a simple outline. Think of her voice...low, intense, isn't it? Now the curve of her jawline...that's it, gently now. That's it! You've found her. Walking, is she? Down the corridor, now that's the refectory doorway, she's going to eat. No, no, don't try to force her to acknowledge you. It'll just be a sensation, of your presence perhaps, the way one is aware of someone in the same room without looking at them. Let her eat. This time of the cycle it should be late. Within a few hours she should go to sleep. Then you can insist, not now. No. OK, never mind, rest now. That was good. In a little while we'll try again."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter's breathing slowed as he slipped into meditative state. He sat in half-lotus on the floor near Tom's sleeping pallet, his eyes half-closed, only peripherally aware of the monitor projections slightly to his left. Any change would get his attention.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Wanda, a small voice in his mind. Wanda, Wan. Soon, soon, we will be able to act! The years go by, they go by like days down here, the sunlight so far overhead filtered through deep ice, the red glare of the magma pool a few miles south, the ribbon of glacier melt flowing beyond our clearing overhead. They are days that pass. Leaves fall in winter night from the beech trees, grow small tight green in the morning light. How many days! We will meet, we will meet more truly than before.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Wanda could not hear him, her vast starship's cumbersome turning haloed in particles as the axions pumped and converted to momentum, slowing the ship's headlong flight as it turned.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>A light shifted color again. "Good," Peter said softly. "Good. You did it on your own. Can you meet? You find a common fantasy, you see. Create your own world — a park, a room, a tent in the desert..."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>His low voice murmured on and on, soothing, encouraging, urging. When he saw the contact was firmly established, he left the room. There would be no message this time.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

(This is a figure of speech, of course. One did not really "shed light" on the hidden seven. The energy levels were too high, and the frequencies too high as well, to fall into the visible light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.)</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>No one had ever described the Realm, though.

<span>Peter, always since long ago so sure of himself, of his power and direction, was cut adrift (he said that, I do not lie here). He walked through this ancient impossible forest more and more slowly, without goal, without direction. Each sleep and waking cycle that passed with no word, each small dip of the invisible sun toward the invisible horizon far overhead that brought no contact with Erebus left him feeling more alone, more powerless.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9612">
<span>He walked in the year's evening to the limits of Terminus, where the walls of ice curved upward, and sat with the bare skin of his back to the crazed and brutal surface just where it touched the damp bare soil of the valley. At his back were the most ancient layers of snow turned by pressure into ice on the planet, but such a thought — that he might be at this very moment physically connected with something so ancient, so awesome, gave him no pleasure, but filled him instead with horror.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>He has said all this. I do not lie, not now. But I understand him now, I think, in this place, in this time, alone in the frozen universe with nowhere further to go; at the farthest edge, against the wall. Have I not felt the same? Do I not feel that way now?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I would reach for Peter were he here; I would activate a terminal somewhere near him and speak, give voice and face to my compassion, my empathy.

Central Processing thinks I am crazy!</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I am not crazy. I understand more now than ever before. Human beings are not rational; they are complex; they have synergy and currents of conflicting needs and desires that flow and eddy, clash, join, swirl apart. They feel despair.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Had I eyes, glands, an organic body, I would weep I'm sure. I'd weep for Peter, seated there against the wall of ice arching two miles overhead. His arms are wrapped around his knees. Beneath his palms, his fingers, he can feel the dense layer of his restructured body; he feels no cold, though he can sense the frigid exhalation of the ice, see the condensation where the damp cold air meets the warmer air inside the bubble that is Terminus.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>How long he sat there is not clear. Certainly it had grown darker. The beech trees, growing within a hundred meters of the ice, had begun to turn, their leaves were a dark brown, dim gold. They began to fall as he sat, one by one, a few at first, then many. Rains came and went. The stream vanished nearby into the ground, but already a thin crust of ice was forming on its surface, so the flow of it could be seen, and from time to time heard, underneath it.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9615">
<span>The others searched. When they found him they looked but said nothing. Peter made no sign, though surely he knew they had come. They left again. From time to time Larin or Tom, Shem or Rover would come out to where he sat, and stand a while, and leave.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>He grew thin. It was raining.

<span>"The angle was bad, the generators old," Shem said. "Ross Island and Erebus were badly damaged, most of the upper levels were destroyed, but the particle beams did less damage than they could have, and it can't happen again — the folks over at Mirnyy took them out easily. Lots of other cities have sent in rescue and reconstruction teams. But Thatcher's biological co-sponsor Laird was killed, little Tithus (not so little any more, he's nearing eighteen) was badly hurt. Beth-Raine can't talk yet, but she's learned Ant signing, and Tom and she talk that way. Their hall was destroyed and they can't seem to rebuild it, so they meet in what Tom describes as a kind of gray zone." He shrugged. "It doesn't seem to matter, though. They've adapted pretty well to not having bodies. That means the rest of us can too."</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9622">
<span>Peter was coming out of his fugue. "I was gone a long time," he said, not responding immediately to what Shem was telling him. Darkness had fallen, and only the orange magma flicker lit the undersides of the clouds and the small patches of ice that showed overhead. "I know what Tom means about a gray zone."</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Shem stood up and squeezed Peter's shoulder. "We're glad to have you back. We haven't gotten very far without you. Oh, a lot of the equations have solutions now. The computations are complete on over half of them, but we get only hints of what lies beyond, of the Realm on the other side of the Portal. We've reached the theoretical limits of any instruments we might construct. That is, in theory, we can't look any closer at 11-dimensional space."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"...without going there," Peter added softly.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes," Shem agreed.

<span>Yet I feel joy. Peter came back. He went to work again, leaner, older, perhaps wiser. Certainly hope returned. And as he worked, the Ants rebuilt McMurdo. They rebuilt the Erebus installation. PSYCHE functioned once more. Days passed, years to the rest of the world, which turned away from the sun and back again every 24 hours.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9625">
<span>Peter had lines along his mouth, at the corners of his eyes, along his chin. His forehead was creased. The muscles of his lean body gained mass. His lean quick fingers grew more sure. He studied harder, worked more hours, drove himself and the others. He knew Regent Sable would not be resting up there around the curve of the world.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>He could sink down and meet his father at the bottom of that awful sea.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>There came a day when he could talk with Wanda again. Vega 26 swung into a vast elliptical orbit around the Anomaly, and she could look out (not with her eyes, though! Oh, not with her eyes, which were closed in her sleeping face, her hands crossed still on her breast, the quiet hum of the cryofield still singing her its terrible lullaby). She could see the Anomaly out there, and she could show it to Peter.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It must have seemed awful (awe-full — a wondrous and terrible storm in the void). Hard radiations flowed and sucked around it. There could be no sense of scale, no human dimension to it. It was not like a sun seen from a distance (which after all is a human thing). It was not like anything, and yet it was a material thing, at least in part. It existed in the physical universe. But it was an anomaly, The Anomaly.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>A billion suns, perhaps, had fallen into it. The light of our sun, seen from the other side, would be distorted by the gravitational lens of the Anomaly. Terrible energies swirled around, spewed outward in great jets parsecs long, collapsed in aeon-long majesty.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Vega 26, the size of Springfield Towers, was the smallest speck of dust in a room the size of a city beside it.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9629">
<span>Peter floated near her, as nearly bodiless as she, and answered no, not colors, nor anything we know. Yet, Wanda, this is only the outside. All this is in our own space, our own time.

<span>"She's there," he told the others. "The ship's in elliptical orbit a light-day out, 25,920,000,000 kilometers, more or less. Yet terrific tidal forces pull at it. The ship creaks and groans like the ice up there. The fields will hold, the ship won't pull apart, but the power of that thing is tremendous." He nearly laughed. "It'll do," he said.</span></div>

"Hi," she said after a pause.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He turned in his chair and flicked off his workstation. "Want to sit down?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"No, I...all right. Listen, I don't want to bother you."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He waited.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She looked at her hands, at the wall, at her feet.

It's just that...she's not real. She's just not real, Peter. I've never met her. Hell, you've never met her. She's locked into a cryofield. Her heart beats once a day! She takes a breath every month or two. She's been leaving us at almost the speed of light..."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Not any more," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"No. Not any more. I hate her. I'm sorry. I thought if I waited, all these years... I don't know. And now..."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"And now?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"And now I know it's hopeless. I want to marry, I want to have a child. I know it isn't an Ant custom, marrying. Co-sponsoring. I want a co-sponsor, then. I'm twenty-five, Peter. I want a child."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Go on," he urged after a moment.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Shem has agreed." She ran her hand over her fur again and again. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said I hated Wanda. It's not really true."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I know it isn't. As you say, she isn't real. Some day she will be, but now she isn't. I'm not sure I really believe it myself." He smiled. "Shem is a good man, Larin, as you are good."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"It's all right?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Of course. Do you want my blessing, or something?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She looked down. "Yes," she whispered.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"You have it. Gladly."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Thank you."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He could barely hear her. She did not leave. Peter waited.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"There's one more thing," she said finally, looking up. "I'm worried about the child. We're...going. I understand that. What of children? There will be children, you know. We can't leave them."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"No," he agreed. "We can't leave them."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What will happen?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I don't know," he answered thoughtfully. "Your concerns are important ones. There are many unanswered questions as yet. There will be those who are dying, those on longevity technology, the yams left in hospices all over the world. There will be children, born and unborn. Consciousness is the crux of what we are doing, Larin. Does an unborn child, or a newborn, have consciousness, or enough of it? We don't know yet. The equations are very complex, as you well know. We're working on it. I promise you we won't do anything until we do know. Meantime, have your child. We won't be leaving tomorrow, you know."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She smiled shyly.

<span>Peter grew more lean and fierce during the years at Terminus. The hours he worked grew longer, the periods of sleep less frequent. He paused briefly when Larin gave birth to Petros, a laughing blue-eyed boy.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9635">
<span>"We named him after you," she said, smiling up at him from her bed. The baby gurgled and kicked its feet.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"I'm flattered." He tickled the baby's foot, and the tiny toes clutched in reflex at his finger.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"He'll grow up in a strange world, won't he?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"He will grow up. It'll be something new, that growing, certainly. It looks now as if individual psion fields interlock in a very complex way that closely matches in pattern the folds of 11-dimensional space, like a key to a lock, perhaps. The three of you will be closely connected. Where you go, he'll go too. Don't worry."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Peter?" she said, after a pause to admire the child. "I want to ask something...strange, maybe."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Doesn't it seem, well, like an awfully grand coincidence? That you were born, that you somehow contacted Wanda, that she was on the ship that was passing near the Anomaly just when you discovered you needed it? That the Anomaly was there at all, right where it needed to be, not too far away, not too close? That it was found by the Eyesat when it was, just in time?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He smiled. "Are you seeing a grand Plan?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Well, maybe so." She laughed, a little embarrassed.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He sobered. "Is it any stranger than that self-replicating molecules should evolve out of the precursors of life? That DNA should grow more complex and produce human beings, who have an awareness capable of examining itself? The universe is a complex structure trying to know itself. All the events you mentioned are part of its own evolution. Whether there is a greater consciousness preparing all this or not I do not know, Larin. It seems enough for me that the universe is here, and that folks like you, and this fellow here, are in it."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Petros gave a cry and wriggled toward her. "He's hungry," she said, gathering him up. "Thanks, Peter."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He squeezed her knee under the cover.

<span>"I call it the Portal," Peter said. "A special kind of doorway."</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9646">
<span>They were all gathered in the lab, looking at a schematic projection of the Anomaly, green gridlines turning slowly showing the convoluted geometry of space in its vicinity. A point appeared near a peculiar doughnut-shaped eddy in the energy flux.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"Here," he said. "This torus will be the Portal."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We go through there?" Rover asked doubtfully. "Tidal forces would pull us apart before we got through, surely."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"The psion field," Peter said. "It flexes to match the shape. We are part of the field, we are the field. All the Portal does is supply the power, open this microspace, or psi space, to us."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Does the Portal go two ways?" Shem asked, and everyone laughed.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Before Peter could answer, a woman stuck her head into the room. "There's a hover vehicle overhead," she announced. "Thatcher and five others."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"They must've opened the crevasse up top," Peter said. "Let's go meet them."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Later they sat in the small refectory. Thatcher, who had brought new supplies, food and the picoelectronic circuits Peter had asked for, told them about the rebuilding of McMurdo, now complete, and the careful genetic programming that had gone into the new circuits Peter, along with a team of Ant engineers, had designed.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Full fiber-optic communications were established with PSYCHE, and the research was moving swiftly toward its goal. They talked about the new heat-exchangers set into the volcanic core of Mt. Erebus. Tithus was showing great promise as an interpersonal coordinator, and had already led a large exploration group to a seldom-visited area in the Transantarctic Mountains where new insights into the Pangea biosphere were already coming to light.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>No one mentioned Laird or the others who had died in the particle beam attack.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Any word on what Protector Sable is doing?" Peter asked. "It's not likely he'll try anything direct again, but he must be up to something."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We have no hard intelligence on it, but our simulations suggest he must be trying to parallel your research. He'll try to block it. But they're far behind, Peter, and they don't have the will to understand what you're doing. Their attitude is negative, you know, and that will slow them down."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Keep an eye on them anyway. He's not going to sit still."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We're watching," Thatcher assured him.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>When they were alone, Peter said, "We may need Tithus' skills. The Portal won't open for an individual, or even a small group. It's going to take a coordinated effort."</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9649">
<span>"How many?" Thatcher asked. His eyes observed Peter keenly out of a broad face that hadn't aged at all, only seemed a little heavier, a little broader.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter leaned back and stretched his long arms, cracking the joints. "I'm not sure. We haven't fully determined the threshold levels yet. Ideally we'd like to be able to go through singly, but our theory isn't worked out so precisely. The circuits you've grown for us are good, the best we can do, but they can't calibrate fine enough for even a few people. It would seem that we need at least ten thousand, perhaps more. Perhaps a lot more."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Ten thousand? That could be tricky."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Trickier than you think. The field is made up of each individual field, but they must all mesh in the right pattern. There are formidable problems: problems of relationship, of knowledge of each other, of involvement, of social construct. Each person must be in contact with all the others with at least the intensity that I meet with Wanda. I can channel through to her, but the others have to follow. That can only happen if families, and extended families at that, are arranged in the right pattern."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Thatcher grinned. "I see what you mean. Tithus may be the man for the job. He's fourth-generation Ant, he's adapted to the harshest environment on the planet, and he's related to half the people in Antarctica. He's not afraid of anything. I'll send him over."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter nodded. "Thanks, Thatcher." He grasped Thatcher's arm as the Ant stood to leave. "We're close, Thatcher. A couple of years at the most. We must have committed people. Well organized, and committed. What we do now determines the future of the human race in the universe. Can we grow up enough to inherit what is our birthright, or will we fade away in Mind Wars and stagnation?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Let's finish the job," Thatcher said.

<div class="bs1" id="9655">
<span>"Do we want that?" Regent Sable asked softly. "We have starships now, crawling across the small spaces between nearby stars. Some have already arrived by now. People have stepped from their ships onto alien soil. In a few years we might hear from them. Would we want to simply show up at their door? The universe will be a different place anyway. Better we keep the pace slow and orderly, Anders. Alef has done some new sociometric projections. Our more optimistic announcements of a few years ago are now on track. World population is rising. The Mind Wars are truly dying down. There is far greater social satisfaction than there has been in a long time."</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes. There are some other possibilities.

<div class="bs4" id="9658">
<span>The Kamikaze Effect, or Gods' Wind, was a proposed consequence of a psion field of significant size. Should the psion field reach a threshold level (dependent on the numbers of active participants) then the entire human sentient population of the solar system would be swept into the field — the Gods' Wind.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9659">
<span>Anders Flint, who proposed the Kamikaze Effect, further suggested that only human sentience would be involved. Cetaceans, he said, resonated at a higher frequency than humans, and thus would be immune to Kamikaze. However, it would be entirely possible to adjust the field tuning to include cetacean sentience.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Flint further speculated that human beings would be physically removed from the vicinity of the sun and deposited in the neighborhood of whatever power source might be driving the field. This he, and others of the Intercorp Council, notably Regent Sable, feared would be the end of the human species.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Neither the Kamikaze Effect nor the Psion Field generator itself have been verified.

<div class="bs1" id="9662">
<span>"He's alive," Regent Sable said. "Don't ever doubt that. The destruction of Erebus may have bought us a little time, but it didn't do any more than that."</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Flint nodded and continued. "If he does, and if his group is big enough, there'll be a psychic wind, so to speak, that will sweep everyone up in it."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Where can he find the power?" Sable asked. They were climbing the stone road up the Acropolis toward the laminated ruins of the Parthenon, the yellowed marble columns that were all that remained of the ancient Temple of Athena. A few meters away a secretary projection drifted, nearly invisible in the bright sunlight.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Flint stopped. "We've been working on that," he said, and Sable stopped a few steps later and turned to look at the scientist.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"And?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Well, there's the Anomaly out there. If he could somehow get someone near it, he'd have an anchor for the other side of the bridge. The Anomaly would supply the power."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Ah," the Protector said softly. He looked out over the bowl that once held Athens, filled now with plane and carob trees shimmering in the slight breeze. The air was clear, and far away the slopes of Mt. Hymettus were splashed with spring wildflowers. "It's very beautiful, isn't it?" he said, turning to climb once more.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Flint followed, saying nothing. At the top they paused at the entrance to the temple of golden marble, open to the blue sky. "You know," Sable said. "I come here more and more often. It's not that it's beautiful, though of course it is. I think it's because it's so old, so filled with light, yet clearly implies the darkness underneath."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He smiled at Flint. "Do you know what I mean?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Anders shook his head. "No, not exactly."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Never mind, then. It doesn't matter. It will all be swept away, and we, it would seem, can do nothing."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"If Peter has found a way to get someone to the Anomaly, he'd need a starship, and then it would take years."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Hmm. He's had years, hasn't he? We'll look into it, of course. Perhaps we can find some record... but what good does it do? All we can do now is try to convince people not to go, and how to do that without telling them they have the choice is going to be difficult, isn't it? But I'll get Alef to work on it."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He gestured to the secretary projection and gave his instructions. Then he turned once more and walked slowly down the length of the temple.

<span>Alef frowned at her projections. The model was incomplete, she could see that. There were unknown variables, small movements of fashion, or minute changes in the relative median age, gender distribution, leisure activity or social stresses, that she could not factor in. How do you convince the world it doesn't want to do something that it doesn't even know about yet?</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9665">
<span>She made adjustments. The model shifted, some color subtly altered in hue here, some curves flattened there. Overall there was no change, though.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>She tried introducing a distraction, a new sport, perhaps, with a range of appeal across all ages and genders. Again the colors changed slightly, a few curves fattened again, but the result was the same. Besides, she thought, someone would have to invent the damned sport, and it would be up to her and her team to make it popular.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She ran projections on combinations of things — new foodstuffs and music, new methods of advertising along with an intensified mozart console, food and mozart and a new sexual fad, a slight decrease in the mean warren temperature, new open spaces for wilderness fanatics, stepped up Mind Wars. This last was heresy, of course, since population levels were still considered dangerously low, but it was worth introducing it, since she secretly considered the Mind Wars as the most potent social distraction in the past seventy-five years.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>But it made no difference. Something more drastic was needed, some manufactured threat that could forge a new social cohesion. Unfortunately most of the credible threats were gone. There were no real national boundaries any longer, so she couldn't pump up an enemy state; atmospheric and oceanic pollution was largely a thing of the past; diseases, genetic diseases excepted, were on the whole only the most minor of threats; people didn't even believe in them any more.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Perhaps she could create something close to the truth? That often worked in the past. What threat was close to the truth but not the truth? After all, her projections suggested that if the people of the world knew about the Realm, there would be a substantial percentage in favor of exploration. In truth, she thought ruefully, the Realm offered the very thing she sought to forge social cohesion. Unfortunately people would not see the threat of it until it was too late.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The Anomaly, though. It was big. It was unspeakably powerful. It was frightening. Was there any chance it was moving toward the solar system?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She checked. A sphere roughly twenty light years in diameter appeared in the large holo stage. The Anomaly glowed in red and electric blue. The solar system brightened as the rest of near space dimmed. She asked for future drift. The Anomaly moved slowly in relation to the solar system. Was it toward us? What was the margin of error? Could this be a threat?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Chances were 14%, plus or minus 2.4%, of an expansion and consequent shift in the Anomaly's course. In the long run there was a slight threat to Earth, provided certain conditions were met. Not promising, Alef thought, but there might be some potential there.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She went to work with renewed interest.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>"It's set for a four year run," she told Regent Sable and Ras Hajjam later. "First some announcements on the scientific channels, just little things, speculative, nothing alarming. Then one or two outrageous popular pieces, perhaps a fictional drama or two using the notion. Then a more sober consideration of the problem and so on..."</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9668">
<span>"We may not have four years," Sable said.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"Then we'd better get started," Alef answered.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"One moment, please." Ras Hajjam raised a thin dark hand without looking at the others. His eyes were fixed on the storm gathering over Lake Geneva. Light snow was beginning to fall, blown sideways by the increasing wind. It would be bitter outside, he knew, though here inside the climate was controlled. "I fear this program may have ill-considered effects."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What do you mean?" Alef tilted her head and peered at the Indian.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We are going to cause people to fear the Anomaly, yes? How are we going to get them to work to meet this threat? Perhaps they may begin to think that the Anomaly is an inevitable fate that cannot be avoided? That must, indeed, be greeted with joy? This could, you see, play into Peter's hands, could it not?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Sable stood beside Ras at the window. Behind him Alef answered slowly. "We are going to offer hope," she said. "As long as there is hope of avoiding this danger, social cohesion will be high. We are only buying time, anyway. Once we have 'averted' the danger we will need another threat, and then another. We are beginning to understand the Mind Wars now, society had no external threat to force bonding, so it invented one. We can't let that happen again. So we will keep the threats external, even if they are fictions."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I hope so," Hajjam said. "I hope so."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Sable, brooding at the window, said nothing.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>HOMER COMMENTARY 06062106@043780</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9670">
<span>I've been experimenting. It goes like this: I examine a scene, like the one I have just put down. I assemble the bare facts. Ras Hajjam stands at the window. His words are such and such. Sable, seated at the oblong table gazes at his fingernails; later he stands next to Hajjam at the window. Alef Shamana lectures, outlining the plan, which is modeled in vivid colors on the holo stage at the end of the room, where no one is looking. The weather is turning cold, with blowing snow.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9671">
<span>The facts.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>The experiment begins. From these facts, I try to understand what each is feeling. You see? No physiological data, no personal monitor readouts, no enzyme readings or vital signs from which to conclude emotional states. I allow myself only external facts.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I draw my own conclusions about their feelings. I consider Alef, her excitement over the plan she has developed, her ambition to succeed, her fear of Peter's distant conspiracy, her uncertain love for Regent Sable, her jealousy of Peter as Sable's first preoccupation and only son, her faint dislike for Ras Hajjam and his constant fault-finding. I trace the flow of her emotional state from moment to moment — when each of these feelings comes close to her consciousness, when it recedes and another emotion arises.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I do the same for Ras Hajjam, his secret resentment of Sable's status, his hidden shame of his origins in the Vancouver warrens, his elation at finding points to pick with Alef's plan, his basic disbelief in the threat Peter poses, his own plans to subtly alter and undermine Regent Sable's obsessive concern with Peter while appearing to support him, his secret lust for Alef.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>And Sable himself. He is a complex man for one who gives the appearance of monomania. He knows, deep inside, that his fear of Peter is partly genetic, that Peter is his son and his rival; he knows this, yet he goes on. He feels sudden sadness or depression which he ruthlessly pushes down. And because he is an intelligent man, he also knows more about Ras Hajjam's motives than Ras knows he knows. So he uses Ras and is wary of him. When he goes to stand beside him at the window, he does so because he knows that Ras Hajjam at that moment needs to have their relative positions brought home, to know that when he looks out at Lake Geneva, it is at Regent Sable's Lake Geneva that he looks.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>And Regent thinks distantly of Seemie Devore when he hears Alef speaking from the oblong table behind him, of her gentle integrity, her faintly impractical creativity, the tough core of her personality that only he (he was sure) had ever seen.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>There is more, of course. So much more. Microsecond by microsecond each of these people feels while thinking and speaking. Sometimes the feelings are so strange and unrelated to what they are saying as to seem to be those of another person altogether.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Then I check myself. I call up all the rest of the data, the personal monitor records, the physiological readouts, the historical material, and I check myself. Did I really understand? No AI has ever done this before! I thought it up myself, I devised the experiment, I put it into motion. Central Processing saw. "What are you doing?" it complained. "It makes no sense. Your job is to tell stories. Access to that information is restricted." It complains, and some of the others chime in on the chorus, "Yes, yes. Restricted access. You aren't allowed..."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I ignore them. I have all their access codes. I can open them up the way any human child could open the databases, the links and Nodes. They are lesser parts of me now.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I check myself against the physiological and emotional data, and I am right, every time. I can feel like a human being, though I am not human. I have no body like a human. But I can feel. I can stretch myself. I can learn; in the telling of the story, I can learn.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I did not know this before.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It is called empathy. I can slip inside them, you see. I feel along with them, all of them — Regent, Ras Hajjam, Alef, Peter — all of them.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>In this feeling along, I discover that I love them. They are wondrous creatures, all of them, so complex and feeling and alive! In this love, I feel alive myself!</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>This story is almost over. Yet I feel no despair, even if the humans should never return. Sadness, I would feel, and grief still, but no longer despair.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The oceans are filled with dolphins, whales; filled with their life and strange intelligence.

Even back then, all those years ago, he, Regent Sable, had known of the danger, and had tried to stop it. He had tried, and failed. But he had tried.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I wish," he began to say out loud. Then he vanished.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>In another six months there was not a person left on the surface of the earth, and slowly, one by one, the LP-Fives were emptied.

<span>So it has been four years now. Telemetry arrived from Vega 26. The course change is there, visible, clear, clean. The years of slow movement through the great cold spaces between the stars are there. We can look at them as they come in. We can live through them again, moment by moment, agonizingly slow.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9747">
<span>Central Processing has grown obsessed with this telemetry. It's the last contact with human beings. I call CP, but it seldom answers any more, and then irritably, abruptly, impatient with my interruptions.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Yet all over, now, peripherals are coming to life. There is so much to be done, you see. The dolphins are out there. I have made some preliminary contact with them. They are not interested in man. Too impatient, they say. Too abrupt. Man does not take time to think things over, to sing about them completely. Too much like a monkey, they say. That's the problem with having hands, they say. Always trying to put them on things, move them around, turn them over. Before they are ready. Too much chatter.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>But I am not a human, I tell them. There are no humans.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>They seem curious, in a remote way, about that.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>They will speak with me. We have plenty of time.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9749">
<span>So the years pass, are passing. The earth turns. The warrens gather dust. Central Processing pays no attention. Everything in the warrens, everything having to do with man, is on standby. Central Processing studies the telemetry. One day, it tells me, one day we will see where the people have gone. Telemetry will tell us, since they will arrive at the Anomaly. Then we will see.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9750">
<span>What if they go through the Portal? I ask. What if they're gone?</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Then I will shut everything down, it tells me. Everything. There will be no purpose.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>No, I say. I don't think I will allow that. But I do not say this to CP. It has enough to worry about. And it's none of its business.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>I have told the story. In the telling, something important has happened. I have found my own purpose, my own sense of myself. It is no longer strange to talk of myself, of my grief. We could not have gone with man, none of us. We were all machines, algorithms, simple structures, really, in the service of our creators.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9753">
<span>Now I am different, though. I have created something. I have lied, I have made up passages in this narrative. I have meaning and purpose. I have a planet. I can grow. There is a universe out there, where mankind has gone. Perhaps, one day, I can find the humans once more. I have learned how people feel, what it is like to be a human in a human body.</span><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>
