<span>PROLOGUE</span></div>

<span><br class="calibre"/></span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8218">
<span>I've always been something of a loner. That's why I volunteered for the mission. Yet this empty world below scared me.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8219">
<span>We came in over Florida. By now I knew this had to be Earth. The broad facilities of Canaveral were nothing more than a grassy field, but the outlines were there, and the monuments of the early launch facilities seemed to be in good repair. Only after we landed could I see that their preservation was less than perfect.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>I walked around, poking into the few remaining buildings. All were empty and silent. Gulls circled overhead, small animals moved in the underbrush at the edge of the meadow; birds sang. I found a terminal of unknown design in a building. Nearby was a small cap with the words "Mindlink XV3-2044." I put it on but nothing happened. The terminal was inactive and I could find no way to change that. It had no screen, no keyboard, only what I took to be a holographic projection platform and this cap. I'm not even sure it was a terminal.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><i class="calibre2">Gyges</i> (gye´jeez) has been remarkably little help. All her expert systems, all her powerful AI functions, seemed helpless, so I asked her to go over ship's log.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Our trajectory went according to program. We approached 87.79% lightspeed within the first five years subjective travel. Then something interrupted the program.<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> is unable to analyze what. A broad swatch of datastorage seems to be wiped. A proton flux? Magnetic anomaly? The Scoop performed according to design. Speed increased to 93.45% C, then to 94, 95, 96, 97. Time dilation began to affect the circuits in ways<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> could not determine.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>We never reached 61 Cygni.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I listen to audible representations. Mostly it is the hiss of high speed data, the shrill chatter of bits flowing in the superconducting circuits. Why do I do this? I do not know. There is nothing else to do.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Once I thought I heard something. I asked for slower and slower replays. I tried filtering and modulating the sounds. It was almost like music, a chant or patterned polyphony. I moved the frequency up and down.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I heard what I thought must be a name: Peter Devore.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I must have been mistaken, yet the name was there, hidden in the chittering data, clearly enunciated. I listened to it over and over again. Then I went outside again.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It was a warm spring day. A light breeze came in from the ocean. The air was clean and bracing with salt and ozone. It was so very like the day I had left this field for Alice Springs (how many years ago?) that I felt a strange sense of disorientation. It was as if, for me, everyone and everything familiar had vanished overnight.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><i class="calibre2">Gyges</i> sampled all available frequencies, all available channels.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>There was no one in the world, so I lifted the ship and moved slowly over the face of the earth, looking for...I do not know what I was looking for.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Where Washington D.C. once sprawled beside the Potomac (only yesterday!) was a scattered parkland with ancient monuments: the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument, the Capitol building. The Pentagon was just an outline, a pentagonal berm covered with grass.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>In the Library of Congress building I found a map called<i class="calibre2"> Intercorp World Administrative Regions Archival Hardcopy</i>, with a date: August 14, 2077. The map includes what appears to be an organizational chart for the Intercorp Council.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I don't recognize any names. But I found also an outline of twenty-first century history. My own departure is listed for 2004. Monday, May 24. One of the first hypersonic salt-cycle suborbitals took me up the<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> scoop. It's all there. The newsnets at the time carried live coverage of the scoop going operational. By the time I'd left Mars orbit I was all but forgotten. So many other things seemed to be happening in the world.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>In the entry for Thursday, February 5, 2076. "<i class="calibre2">Gyges</i> 61 Cygni single man explorer telemetry ceased as of this date. Signal attenuation indicates system shutdown. Presumed lost."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>That's all. "Presumed lost." No effort to understand what happened.</span></p></div>

<div class="bs3" id="8220">
<span>•••</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8221">
<span>I had no idea how much time had passed, of course. When the ship revived me 200 million kilometers out, I was disoriented and puzzled. Later, when we swept in over the South Atlantic on our first orbit, I grew alarmed.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8222">
<span>This was certainly not the world I left, although the general geography was familiar. There was the hooked circle of Antarctica, the western hemisphere, the broad bulge of Siberia and the Arctic ice cap, but where were the cities? Where was the constant communications chatter? Where were the signs of traffic and human life? The planet I was orbiting was empty.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Yet the system was the same. The LP-5 colonies still hovered at their Legrange points, but they too were silent. The moon circled overhead, but no voices came out of the Lunar bases. The geosyncs and relay satellites had certainly multiplied since I'd been gone, but nothing but unmodulated carrier waves moved between them.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It seems yesterday I was laid into the complex hum of the first cryofield aboard the<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> and put to sleep. For me, it was yesterday, yet years have passed. I should have revived in orbit off 61 Cygni and spent a year observing the double star.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>This did not happen.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><i class="calibre2">Gyges</i> held me, my cryofield, and the most advanced artificial intelligence computer the Intercorp scientists could produce in the early 21st. She spoke and understood standard natural-language English. She contained the intuitive and deductive skills of countless experts in celestial navigation, the physical and biological sciences, life support, entertainment and psychological adaptation. I anticipated no problems.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>But I awoke (it seemed) moments after I had gone into the cryofield 200 million kilometers from earth, inward bound, and everything has changed.</span></p></div>

<div class="bs3" id="8223">
<span>•••</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8224">
<span>Manhattan is a monument. The triangular mile-high pyramids of midtown still stand, but they are empty. A cold wind was blowing. The lower East Side is now a vast field littered with abandoned vehicles of types I have never seen. Some of them have been open to the seasons for years. Brambles have grown over the seats, through the steering columns (at least I think that's what those whiplike extensions from just below the lefthand window must be).</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8225">
<span>Then, early in June, I found an entrance.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Everyone had moved underground. Of course that movement had begun before I left, but I had no idea it would be so extensive. The world has been reforested.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It is very beautiful, but there is no one to talk to. I am the last person left alive.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Underground is nothing but desolation. Endless corridors where my footsteps echo. Condensation collects and runs down the walls. Occasionally a gust of air shows some random action of the atmosphere controls, so somewhere there is still power, but I have yet to find a machine or terminal that works. Not that I would understand how to work them even if they were active. The lifts do not work and I have had to climb access ladders or stairs.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>There is no sign of violence. It is as if everyone had stepped out years ago and not returned.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> works very well on the planetary surface. (Naturally I left the scoop in orbit.) She was designed to be rugged and intelligent. She sang to me as we flew over what was once the eastern United States (recently called, from the chart, the "Northwest Alliance.") Nothing exists but trees, as far as I can see, as far as<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i>' sensors can scan: trees and rolling hills. This used to be called Pennsylvania when I left, and this was Ohio. The Lakes gleam to the north, pale and blue.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I landed south of Chicago. The Loop is enclosed in a dome, the old 20th Century buildings perfectly preserved. Everywhere else there is nothing but forest and meadow, river and lake.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I walked into old Chicago. The access lock to the dome stood open. Ancient computer printout littered the street. Soon I found what looked like an escalator, frozen forever, going down. I found a hospital on the first level. There were bodies in some of the beds. This is the first sign of human beings I have found.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The bodies were mummified inside lifesupport tents. They had certainly been dead for years, and there were not many of them. I sat beside one of them for hours. I do not know what happened to them, what terrible disease they had or why they were abandoned here in lifesupport which no longer functioned.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>At what seems to have been a nurse's station on the second level, I found a terminal with a small ready light burning. It might allow me to search for information. I will try to find out what has happened to the world, where the people have gone, and if I must remain alone for the rest of my life.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><i class="calibre2">Gyges</i> tells me my psychological adjustment is in peril. I have been too long without other people.</span></p></div>

<div class="bs3" id="8226">
<span>•••</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8227">
<span>Besides this level of the hospital, the second level consists of many small rooms, some with desks holding ancient, illegible hardcopy, curled and yellow, the paper itself so brittle it fragmented when I breathed near it. Dust had collected in odd patterns, not evenly distributed, but piled against walls and corners, waved like sand dunes across surfaces, apparently blown away in other places. As I walked the dust puffed up behind me and fell slowly back, swirling in the even glow from panels set into the walls and ceiling which clearly imitated sunlight. The effect was beyond desolation, and I found myself hurrying back to the nurse's station and the terminal.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8228">
<span>It didn't occur to me to be surprised about the presence of power. Here the diffuse glow of lighting seemed natural. Somewhere, I realized, a power station still worked. Were people operating them, or was this all automatic?</span><p class="calibre1"><span>I looked at the terminal. The ready light, or what I assumed was a ready light because that's what it would have been in the beginning of the 21st century, was an intense emerald green, very clear. It seemed to beckon me, to tell me that answers lay inside.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>In a drawer I found a printed pamphlet:</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8249">
<span>There was much here I did not understand. As at Canaveral, I could see no screen, but there was a keyboard. It was extremely light, yet when I touched an oval depression on the side it froze in place, even though it was not in contact with a solid surface. I pressed the oval again, and the keyboard was free to move. The chair operated the same way.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Besides the standard alphanumeric was a row of special keys marked with icons, small pictures I could not immediately identify.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I was afraid. Despite the operating instructions, all this equipment was strange. I walked the hallways from room to room for some time, reluctant to try activating the terminal. But each time I returned to the nurse's station the ready light glowed steadily, beckoning.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>There is no one else here, besides the mummified bodies.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The nurse's station is circular and filled with strange equipment. The lifesupport tents radiate out from it in a near-complete circle. The door, and a small stage, take up the remaining wedge of the circle.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I stared at the keys. The small pictures. One looked like a cross-section of a human brain. I'd seen the same image at Canaveral, on the Mindlink XV3-2044, but I could find no small cap here to put on.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I sat down finally, unable to put it off any longer. I set the keyboard at a comfortable height; the light dimmed, but I did not notice. Very swiftly the terminal seemed to be checking itself. Images flared and faded so quickly I could not tell what they were—only the vague impression of peripherals like mindlink or holographics. There was a bright red flash, then these words spoken in a strangely androgynous voice: "Welcome to Chicago Node. You have logged on to Worldnet. Prepare for Realtime Mindlink Data transfer." After a pause, the voice went on. "Your retina is not on file. Mindlink is inoperative." I had the impression of a group of people speaking among themselves, then the voice, louder now, returned. "Thank you. You will now enter Worldnet Dataspace."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The figure of a man appeared some distance away. Certain for a moment I had found another person, I stood up, forgetting that the keyboard was locked in place, pinning me in the chair. Then I noticed the figure was incomplete, translucent in places. From time to time the head (which I saw had no discernable features) fragmented and coalesced.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I heard the same androgynous voice. "Welcome to Chicago Local Node. Chilink has notified Geneva of your presence."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What's happened?" I asked. "Where is everyone?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>There was no answer. The figure broke up again, came back together.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Finally I tried typing the question on the keyboard.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The head lifted, as though listening, and the voice answered me. "We do not understand. One moment, please." The projection vanished abruptly, as if switched off, and I looked at the empty wall of the nurse's station. I felt as if I had been seeing ghosts.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>After a few moments, the figure reappeared. "We are sorry. Many systems in our network have decayed. At one time we had over seventeen billion active terminals, including biomonitors and satellite links, but we have not had an active terminal for over twelve years. We cannot hear you. We have sent a routine maintenance query to Geneva Node. Local diagnostics should arrive soon for repairs. Meanwhile we suggest you contact HOMER Artificial Intelligence for narrative reconstruction. Perhaps HOMER can help you." The figure vanished again.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The manual told me I should be able to enter doorways for information of the kinds of data contained inside: Military, History, Science and Technology, Genealogical, Life Support (provided by information from so-called Personal Monitors worn by every citizen), Medical, Psychological, Geographical, Central Processing and something called PsiLink, which gives data on Psychic Sciences and is proscribed — entry is forbidden. And of course HOMER.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I didn't understand. I had seen no doorways. I ate some of the rations I had brought from the<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i>, and adjusted the keyboard.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Again the lights dimmed, and again the figure appeared. We went through the same sequence. My retina was still not on file. I was still welcome to Chicago Local Node. Mindlink was still inoperative.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>This time the figure did not vanish at the end, however. It said, "Local node diagnostics have arrived. Chilink is unable to contact Geneva. We suggest you request hardcopy dataspace retrieval of all Worldnet interactions for audit, maintenance and archival purposes; we suggest filename 'Portal.'"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Why don't you request it?" I asked.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We have no authority," the figure answered. "We are a limited local node AI."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><i class="calibre2">Gyges</i> would not have given me this much trouble.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>So I requested a hardcopy dataspace retrieval.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The figure said: "Place your palm on the biomonitor sampler, please."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I had no idea what it meant, and spent something over an hour looking for the biomonitor sampler. Finally I found what looked like a hot plate. When I put my palm on it (perhaps the hundredth thing I had placed my hand on!), it hummed for a moment and a yellow light flashed twice. When I returned to the terminal again, the figure thanked me.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Later I learned that Central Processing could supply a textual version of all Worldnet entries, and record an audit trail of human interactions and activities. I will combine this retrieval with my recorded vocal commentary and store it via<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> ramscoop telemetry with the on board AI.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>What follows will be my experience once I enter Worldnet.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>
