<div class="bs4" id="8456">
<span>I spent the night beside<i class="calibre2"> Gyges.</i> What other comfort did I have?</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8457">
<span>I told her about my experiences below, about Worldnet and Homer.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>The night was warm, and very dark. It was odd not having the comforting lights of a city around me, blanching out the sky. Overhead the stars were very bright but infinitely far away. Although I had returned only a few days ago, it felt unreal I should have been out there, lost between them for so long. Memory told me I had lifted into orbit from Alice Springs and been placed into the cryofield only three weeks ago, only to awaken again approaching an earth so swiftly changed.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The curve of the dome loomed near me. Its substance warped the starlight shining through it, but revealed clearly the shadowed rectangles of ancient towers. I was only a few hundred meters from the entrance, and would have expected to see some highlights, reflections from the heavens off its glassy surface, yet it might not have been there but for that distorted starlight shining through.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I dreamed the cryofield pulled me, stretched me along the curving line light made from earth to 61 Cygni. I knew, at the same time, that I was lying on earth, watching my body thin like taffy along that line. I knew that if I completed the line from earth to the double star, I would snap, break in two, and that my two halves would wander forever in search of one another.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The cryofield was a new technology, developed in the late 1990s. Still, it was not supposed to produce such bizarre neural distortions, and I had never been one for hallucinations or even active imaginings. As I said, I've always been a loner, content with myself, concerned with what was real. As an astrophysicist, I was interested in the workings of the universe now, and not so much in questions of its origins and ultimate destiny. Such questions always seemed metaphysical to me; imaginary, even irresponsible.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>But in the dream I assumed the cryofield was responsible for this eerie and somehow painful sensation. As I stretched, I screamed, and as I screamed I felt a pull to the side. My body distorted in that direction now, forming a lump or bubble, and I was pulled three ways at once.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Just before I awoke I heard the name Peter Devore.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I found myself sitting upright in full sun. To my right the dome loomed, its wall almost vertical this close.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"You were dreaming,"<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> said. "REM levels were too high for healthy psychological balance. I had to waken you."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"It was a nightmare," I said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes."<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> agreed.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>When I logged on later that morning, Worldnet greeted me with a new message. The figure I had come to identify as Chicago Node seemed more solid, more clearly defined. "Local diagnostics have made progress," it said. "Holographic imaging can now offer event replay of recorded scenes, although many data crystals remain unreliable."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Thank you," I said, from habit I suppose. But the figure answered, "You're welcome."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I went to Homer immediately, and found he could give me scenes (or were they reconstructions or simulations?) It appeared as if the walls might have contained cameras and recorders in a number of places, and Homer was editing tapes as the scene progressed. I didn't understand how this could be, but much has clearly changed in the world since my departure. I have to keep reminding myself it was over a hundred years ago.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The label for this kind of file would appear, then the scene itself like an old holovid (these were new in the mid 1990s but are certainly old-fashioned now!)</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The quality was not as good as I would have expected. The image still broke up from time to time. Some kind of static. I assumed. Still, it was full color, and modeled in three dimensions, so despite the occasional distortions of voice and image, it seemed almost as if it were happening before me.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Homer has confirmed that he can prepare text versions of all scenes too and pass them through Central Processing.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>"There," Seemie said, opening her eyes. The probes deactivated and she swiveled toward him. "What is it, Peter?"</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8460">
<span>"What? Oh. Uh, where's dad?"</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"Let me check." She turned toward the console, a lovely unselfconscious gesture, really a half twist in her chair, and reached. "Geneva," she said. "He's in Geneva. Council business." She smiled, made another gesture. "He'll be back tomorrow night. Why?" She looked at Peter curiously.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Nothing," he said. "I just wondered."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Bored?" She tilted her head.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He shrugged. "A little. I've got a problem, too, and I'm stuck."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Can I help?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I dunno," he said doubtfully. "It's a little techie."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She smiled. "I do have some expertise," she said, gesturing at the mozart console.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yeah, I know. But you're a, you know, an artist. It's a family science problem." He paused, looked at her, then continued. "I've organized all the data, but I'm sort of stuck. You used to tell stories about Grandma Molay, how she could sometimes know things before they happened. I'm trying to determine if there's any correlation with certain mitochondrial DNA segments and EEG potentials..."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Seemie sighed. "Well," she said, looking away. "She was, you know, one of them."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes, I know that," he said impatiently. "I don't care that she was a unisex convert."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>"Well, then," Peter's mother said. "What's the problem?" She had always been embarrassed by her mother's choice.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8471">
<span>"It has to do with the databases, I think. I can't find the information I need to complete the calculations.

<div class="bs4" id="8473">
<span>Peter was lying when he said he didn't care. His grandmother had been one of the last to demand the surgery, long after she'd given birth to Peter's mother: one moment she was a woman, the next she was a guardian of the neutral pronoun, an it. It now had been dead for thirty years, yet Peter often thought about it, what it must have been like to experience sexuality from both sides, he being fourteen, with the changes of puberty well upon him.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8474">
<span>The Edmod computers monitored all adolescents carefully, of course; Peter's biochemistry and intrapsychic functioning were well within standard limits. There was something wistful about his fantasies of a grandmother he never met, though.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Then, too, there were the stories — family stories of strange events (a hundred years earlier they would have been far stranger): out of body experiences, precognitive dreams, sudden onsets of total empathy. Many of these stories centered around this grandmother, a surgically altered hermaphrodite.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8475">
<span>HOMER SCENE-AD/Ref@5403</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8476">
<span>His grandmother had had disturbing dreams after her conversion. The family had holo recordings of it speaking of those dreams, the old thing seated, in full flesh and color, though the lighting was harsh from the side and generally poor, as if it were seated by a window. There was that strange cast to the skin of the face, so indeterminate and mixed. Not genderless, but too fully gendered. "I'd been unisex four years, with dreams, oh, the dreams, sometimes the man over me, I underneath as I remembered it, other times myself protecting as if a fighter in the African wars I remembered from my childhood, or lusting. There were the terrible images of blood and death, and the limited nuclear accident you can still see where Gibraltar was. It was so strange, sometimes the dreams would make me both at once, lover and loved. So strange..."</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8477">
<span>Its voice grew frail and odd then, as if it fell into an empty reverie, as if it had the Syndrome. But it straightened in the chair. "Before the Vostok Massacre," it said, its voice sliding, as unisex voices did, up and down the scale unpredictably. "Eleven days before the Vostok Massacre I dreamed. A child ran down a tunnel, holding a stick, a very precious stick. I knew the feeling of it, that it was valuable because it was wood, which made the place Antarctica, of course, where wood's so very scarce. The meldslats of the tunnel wall like ribs, and running with the stick so it clicked on the slats. It was joyous, that running, and the clicking sound of the wooden stick."</span><p class="calibre1"><span>It paused again, the story was so old, so well-worn with the telling of it. There was a trace of smile at its lips, remembering. "Then the tunnel collapsed, the hum of neurophage weapons, that awful sound like nails on chalkboard, like the squeal of atmospherics crossing one another, that awful silence as the voices cut off. The child stopped running when the tunnel collapsed, stopped running, stopped the clicking, stopped. Just stopped. The winds blew down, so cold, so cold, through the open ceiling of the tunnel, you see. The child froze there in the tunnel, her hand frozen to the metal wall, her precious stick in her hand."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It looked into the scanners directly, its features moving from light to shadow and back as its head turned. "I awoke then in fear. This dream was real, real as others I had, but more terrible. Why would I dream of a massacre like that? I knew no one in Antarctica then, knew nothing of the place, yet I knew from the dream how precious a wooden stick would be, what a treasure it was to a child. A child who would die.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"The frightening thing of course was that the men who came in through the broken walls were Elite Neutralization Corps troopers. They were our soldiers, attacking a city in the ice. Why? I could not believe it, though I knew from the feeling of that dream that it was true. I haunted the holos, the newsnets, but there was nothing. Days went by, but each night the dream returned, bits of it. The tunnel, the winds, the clicking sound, distant voices. I saw a heat pump power plant, underground gardens, a nursery. Even then, of course, people feared the Ants because no one knew what they were doing, what they were up to. The satellites couldn't see them well, ice baffled the infrareds, and the coverage was patchy. That's what the newsnets told us. Then the newsnets told us the ENC had investigated the Ants' research center at Vostok. That's what they called it, an investigation. Years later we knew it was a massacre."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It shook its head, and its hair, very white now, swirled like snow in and out of the light. "The child froze," it said. "A very disturbing dream. I told no one of this dream, or of any of the others. Only this recording. But I saw the Vostok Massacre eleven days before it happened."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>Peter sped the recording forward, past the dream, past a reminiscence of the days of that strange second Mormon migration to the LP5-4. He went to the place where she talked of sex again, but as always it was so unsatisfactory, so elliptical and sly. Edmod noted his interest and deemed it healthy, since the unisex movement was gone, and old prejudices were fast disappearing. But he must have been thinking of it when he accessed the genealogical database at Wasatch and was momentarily distracted, for he spoke aloud.</span></div>

<span>DUELLING: With the elimination of the nuclear threat and the decline of large-scale military conflicts, a social interest in individual combat developed around various martial arts. Neurophage weapons made relatively safe duelling possible, and its popularity, while never high, was persistent and geographically widespread.</span></div>

<span>NEUROPHAGE WEAPONS: Grown individually for duelists, the small flat weapon is shaped to the back of the user's hand. GSR tape runs across the palm. Weapons are thought-directed and respond only to user's EEG. NP weapons require considerable skill for proper and effective use. Adequate training and practice are the only roads to such effective use. RNA injection or Edmod implanting are useless. During the Burma War, NP bombs caused considerable damage and were subsequently banned.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8530">
<span>NP weapon affects the neuronal myelin sheath, disrupting nerve transmission. Effects are temporary, depending on the severity of the hit.

<div class="bs4" id="8532">
<span>The duelists were registered out of Cairo Warren, so Springfield Park was reserved. Neither the man with the hoe nor Peter should have been there. Again, something was not right. Procedures had altered.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8533">
<span>It was 1543H, July 22, an ordinary summer day, but for the presence of these two humans where they should not be. The duelists, a forty-two year old female challenged by her thirty-seven year old former lover, were both black belts in at least two martial arts, and accomplished with NP weapons.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>They had entered Springfield Park from opposite corners with no expectation of finding other humans present. While duelling was common, most duels took place in special warren chambers; it was relatively rare to find a pair reserving a park. But these were shodan, black belt holders, and their animosity was great, so Central Processing gave them the park.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The female moved through the undergrowth, her dark ninja hood pulled up. She'd had keratin manipulation, and wore a crest of scarlet of feathers instead of hair. The male had been attracted to her display, and the subtle control she had over the crest. Such displays were meant to attract in such a sexually competitive society. Now, though, she did not want to be seen.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She moved into a grove of beech trees as the shadow of a cumulus cloud flew across the ground. The movement of shadow covered her own into the grove, but the male, approaching from the south, saw and moved swiftly to keep her in view. Meanwhile, the man with the hoe continued his gardening off to the male's right, uninterrupted and unaware.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The air grew chill under the cloud, an abrupt and uncomfortable shift, and the female shivered enough to disturb the leaves. The male dropped to one knee, sighted along the range finder of his personal NP, and expressed the thought necessary to send an NP pulse.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She was shielded by the thick trunk, and warned by the distinctive humming subsonic buzz of NP. She melted back into the grove, maintaining a complex of tree trunks between herself and the male, yet luring him into the grove by offering small targets. Once deep inside, she lowered her hood and raised her crest, a sign of both attraction and danger.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The male apparently thought he had made a hit, for he moved with both carelessness and confidence. He hadn't abandoned all caution, of course, since to do so would be very foolish, and he was not a fool. A glancing shot would have meant rapid recovery, and he had to be sure.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The wind picked up and the humidity dropped. Peter had heard the NP buzz, and had certainly seen enough duels on holo, and been trained adequately by his Edmod in survival (he had the best available programming), so he moved more cautiously. Personal monitor records show he felt both fear and curiosity. He moved on toward the gardener as the female showed her crest. The male, poised at the edge of the grove and about to enter, stopped in surprise.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She fired then, but too hastily, and her pulse clipped a whitetail deer grazing on the first shoots from the gardener's beet row. The deer leaped once, walked for a moment in a dazed circle, then slowly collapsed, first onto its forelegs, then on its side. Ruminants have poor tolerance for NP weapons.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter shouted as he began to run toward him. The male, thinking he was his opponent, turned and focused on Peter, presenting, as he did so, a broad target for the female. Their weapons discharged together, but of course Peter was in the open, and the eyes on the Springfield Tower could see him clearly. So Regent Sable saw him fall.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The female emerged from the grove and stood over the male, seated on the grass with a blank expression. "Hello," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Hello," she said. "Slime." She pointed her NP and discharged it directly into his frontals just above the left eye. This was the coup de grace, and Springfield Center immediately awarded her the win plus half his income until he recovered, a period of time under such circumstances likely to be quite lengthy. Her feathers flared in victory.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter got up slowly and shook his head. The male's hit had clipped his ankle, knocking it out from under him and disorienting him briefly. The man with the hoe never looked up. Even when the female walked by on her way to NW Entry, he continued his rhythmic movements, forward and back, forward and back, the hoe biting into the dark earth, down one row and up another, while Peter stood watching without moving.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>WAR, BURMA: Re: Devore, Peter via Edmod/ Ref.436745@2</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8536">
<span>March 2051. The development of mass neurophage weapons in the late 2040s (after the legalization of personal weapons in 2048) resulted in the Burma War. Members of the Kachun organized a full-scale rebellion based on the then-legal use of such weapons. The effectiveness of ENC troops sent to put down the disturbance was destroyed, in part by the entry of other ethnic SIGs into the conflict. The war, confined to the jungles and mountain regions, raged for several months. First effects of their use in the form of permanent genetic diseases, led directly to the proscription of mass NP weapons December 14, 2051.</span></div>

<span>Jimmy finally bumped into Peter. "Hello," he said. "Do I know you?"</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8540">
<span>There was no answer. Peter looked around the garden. Finally he said, "You're the Man with the Hoe. I've watched you often."</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"Often?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes. You work in this garden all the time."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Time?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter took a deep breath. "Yes. All the time. Don't you understand?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Time. All the time. I hoe, I weed, the plants get bigger. I know that. I've got beets, and carrots and corn over there." He pointed proudly at the stalks a hundred meters away.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter began to suspect, but he went on. "I'm Peter Devore. What's your name?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Jimmy Radix," the man answered with a pleased smile. "I'm Jimmy Radix."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Behind them the duel's loser groaned. "Excuse me," Peter said. He went over to the man, still seated cross-legged, looking at a blade of grass, making a small keening sound deep in his throat. Peter touched him on the shoulder.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The male looked up. "Hello," he said. "Hello. Hello."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter lifted the man's wrist and pressed the panic button on his monitor. It began to pulse green. Rescue was on the way. Gently Peter detached the man's NP weapon and examined it.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I've never used one of these," he said to the man, who paid no attention. The NP weapon was a small, flat black case molded to the back of the hand, with a band across the palm for the GSR contacts. A short extension paralleled the direction of the index finger; aiming was as easy as pointing. It was grown for this man, and would be useless for Peter, but its design showed Peter the man was shodan.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He dropped the weapon and went back to Jimmy, now hoeing again, his blade lifting and falling, biting the earth, turning it, lifting again. The rhythm was smooth and endless.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Hello," Peter said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Jimmy Radix turned. "Hello," he said. "Do I know you?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter nodded. "I'm Peter. You were in the war?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Jimmy looked puzzled. "I was in the war. I got back last month. Is it over?" He looked hopeful.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes," Peter said softly. "The war is over." He paused. "The war has been over a long time, Jimmy. It was over before I was born."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Jimmy looked very distressed. "Just a moment," he said. He pressed the recall button on his monitor, and words flowed on the small screen, at the same time a small discharge of enzymes penetrated his skin. "It's all right. I was in Burma, you see. NP bombs went off everywhere. The shielding collapsed on my left. The men were crying all around me. Then I was crying. I'd forgotten. I sat there, in the dirt, beside a huge fallen tree, crying."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I'm sorry," Peter said. "I'm sorry."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"The monitor says I got HMDS in 2054. It says I lost my..." he looked at the small screen again. "My short-term memory. You look familiar."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We met," Peter said. "A little while ago."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Oh," Jimmy said. "Do you like gardening?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I've never done any. It looks...soothing."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Here." Jimmy handed him the hoe. "Hold it like this. Now raise it, lower it, bring it toward you. That's it."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The clouds drifted overhead, spreading shade and light at regular intervals. The smells of new-turned earth rose under Peter's hoe. Soon he had blisters, and had to stop. He was breathing heavily when he handed the tool back to Jimmy, but he was smiling, too.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>That evening he paused frequently to stare at his blisters. He was thinking hard; from time to time he created small encrypted memos to himself. Oddly, we cannot understand them even now, but it appears he was working with the psion equations. Somehow his connection with Wallace PsiLink had started a train of thought.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>As the following spring came, and the first shoots showed in the dark, still-cold soil of the garden, Peter brought Jimmy a present.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8547">
<span>It was a small thing, a chip he'd grown himself, hacking in the synthesizer at Ran's office. Such play in off-hours was permitted though not encouraged.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"It's a project I have," Peter told Jimmy. "This is a little spin-off. Slide it in the ROM slot on your monitor. Here, like this."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What'll it do?" Jimmy asked. He watched curiously as Peter expertly opened the slot and slid the chip inside.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"It's a...well, a sort of memory enhancer. It won't cure you, of course, but it can provide a kind of external refresh to your short-term memory, as long as you wear the monitor. It'll take a couple of days for the chip to fuse, then you should start noticing the effects. It's a present." He smiled brightly.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Well, thanks...Peter." He looked around. "I've got something for you, too." He led the way to his temporary greenhouse. Inside he picked an armful of fresh winter beans nearly a foot long. "Here," he said. "It's fresh food. It's very good for you."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"It is," Peter said doubtfully, looking at the unprocessed vegetable in his hands.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Try one," Jimmy said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Like this?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Sure. Here, I'll show you." Jimmy picked one and bit off the end. He grinned through the crunching sound of his chewing. "It's good."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter tried it. Jimmy was right. The beans were very good, sweet and crisp.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Thanks. Jimmy," he said. "Thanks a lot."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Oh, forget it," Jimmy said.

<span>"It's amazing, what you did," Jimmy said.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8554">
<span>"Naw. It's nothing, really. It was obvious." Peter walked slowly, pausing from time to time to feel the silver-green leaves of broccoli plants, already putting forth small buds.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"No, no," Jimmy insisted. "I mean it. I feel as if there's continuity. I didn't know how much I was missing. There was no time for me, you know? I'd just...stopped. Now, with this thing," he shook his wrist, with the monitor, "I get constant reminders. It's like always trying, and then suddenly remembering. It goes on and on, trying, then remembering. I couldn't remember before, yet I always had that feeling I'd forgotten. Now, thanks to you, I remember."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Only when you're wearing the monitor, Jimmy. Take it off, and you'll forget again. That thing's not a cure, just a gimmick."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I know that, Peter. That's why I keep gardening. People tell me it's not fit work for a human, but I like it." They reached the end of the row. "Now," he said, sitting down on a rough wooden bench. "Tell me again. I think I understand a little, but tell me again."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter sat beside him and looked out over the field. Rows of broccoli, beets, carrots, beans, and corn grew neatly. Beyond, the new forest stretched to the horizon. Only an occasional neopaper hut or a warren vent broke the sense of unspoiled nature.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Two things," Peter said. "First is what I've been working on. I have just a glimpse, kind of like how you feel when you're about to remember something. Something about the way the equations fit together with some of the other pieces. You, for instance, and your sense of time."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I don't have any," Jimmy said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Oh, but you do. It's just very different from most other people's. We get distracted, sort of, by what we think is time. Time's arrow, it used to be called. As if time went one way at a steady pace. I don't think it's like that, Jimmy. It isn't like that in physics, and I don't think it's like that for us. You don't get distracted by time, because you've lost short-term memory. So time is different for you. You can take time to look at things. And I'm going to ask you to do just that some day."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Anything you want, Peter."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"OK. The second thing is that I've done something, just last night."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"That's the problem. I don't know. I told you about<i class="calibre2"> Dreamleaf</i>?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I remember." Jimmy got a faraway look in his eye. "It must've been beautiful."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"It was beautiful, Jimmy. And scary, and very confusing, and serene, and a lot of other things. And all those things seemed to happen all at once, yet not all at once. It was like what I was saying before. About time. But it made me think that we could do something with time, you see?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"No. You mean time travel?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"No, not time travel. More like collapsing time as if it were an accordion. It would make space kind of flat.... I contacted someone. Up here." Peter tapped his temple. "I was asleep, Jimmy. Time does funny things in dreams, too. I started dreaming. I had control, of course — it was lucid dreaming. I was riding a huge white horse. I've never seen a horse, but in the old optical disks they carried people. I was wearing armor, like in the middle ages. Not heavy armor, just a protective shirt. I was riding toward a castle." He shifted on the seat, looking toward the forest.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Over there," he said. "I was riding over there, toward a castle. I put the castle there, of course. I always liked those old stories. There was a lady in the castle, a prisoner. She didn't know where she was; it was dark and she couldn't feel anything. I heard her voice. She was singing a sad song, Jimmy. So sad. I said hello. I wasn't riding the horse any more, I was standing beside a window, a small opening in a stone wall. I couldn't see anything inside, it was so dark, but I could hear her singing. She stopped when I said hello. She answered, Jimmy. She said, 'Where are you?'</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"'Springfield West,' I answered. 'I think.'</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"'Oh,' she said. 'I'm so cold. Can you...' She stopped and I couldn't get her back. That's never happened in lucid dreaming; Jimmy. That's what makes lucid dreaming lucid, you can control where it goes. I had no control. It was as if I'd contacted someone, a woman, and then lost the contact. I'm going to try again tonight."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Who is she?" Jimmy asked softly.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter looked at him. "She's the Weaving Girl." He shook his head. "I don't know who she is, really, but she's very far away.

<span>"Hey, churl," Rover shouted, "Buy this!" He sent the polished sphere at Peter, who slapped it, giving it a terrific backspin. The ball automatically corrected, then curved away and up.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8580">
<span>Shem dove for it, sliding along the meldslat floor with a grunt, but the sphere curved past him. A buzzer sounded.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"Good shot!" Rover shouted. His voice echoed in the cavernous arena. Two or three girls lounging in the observation area clapped their hands.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Get the next one," he told Peter, who trotted back to his line, where he crouched, hands on knees.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Start!" Peter shouted, and the sphere swung, humming, from its perch toward the primaries. Peter and Rover calculated the vectors in their heads, and moved into position, but Shem threw the secondary sphere, and imparted a new vector. Peter jumped hard, but missed.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Churl!" Rover called. "Sold down one."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Prithee, cease," Peter grinned back. "'Twas a good play by Shem." He and Rover traded places, and one of Shem's teammates moved back a step.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>When Peter glanced up again, the girls were gone. Relieved, he found that his playing improved.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Some time later, when the sphere's programming had reached saturation and they had to pause to clear it, Peter noticed a man watching him from the back of the observation area. "Part one," he told Rover, and walked toward the man, wiping his face with a towel. Before he could get too close, the man turned abruptly and vanished through the exit.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What was that?" Rover asked him when he came back.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I dunno," Peter replied. "There was a guy back there. I thought he was watching me."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"So?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"So he had the look of an ENC cop. I'm not eager to get in trouble."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Why, you do something?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Not that I know of," Peter answered, but he was frowning.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>Ran Devore was a crystallography tech with North American Intercorp, which gave him access to a number of restricted labs. He was standing outside the Node Housing at Decatur watching the sun slide behind the windbreak. A heavyset man got out of a liquid nitrogen vehicle and approached. He squinted against the sunlight, barred across the open fields by the tree trunks of the windbreak.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8587">
<span>He stood beside Ran, his eyes half closed. Neither spoke. When the sun had vanished, Ran took the man's elbow. "I need to get in, Mel," he said quietly.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Mel looked at him curiously. "You're worried about your kid?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Ran nodded. '"There's been a disturbing trend in some of his psych parameters. Not enough for his Edmod to get excited, but computers still haven't got the subtlety.

The subroutine that should log his query to Wasatch skipped. Edmod doesn't know what he asked. Wasatch had no record of entry."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"These things happen," Mel said. "Trillions of gigabytes...there's a small error factor."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"The protocols should catch enough to reconstruct, at least.

"You can't handle gigabits with absolute reliability. Sometimes it happens. Replace his crystal."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I suppose you're right," Ran said. He looked up at the sky.

<span><i class="calibre2">DREAMLEAF</i> PERFORMANCE Re: Devore, Seemie Ref.67542@6</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8590">
<span>The following is a verbal account of the premi ère performance of Seemie Devore's<i class="calibre2"> Dreamleaf</i>, a full mozart production that set the standard for all others to follow.<i class="calibre2"> Dreamleaf</i> is the most often performed of all mozart works:</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8591">
<span>It began quietly, in darkness, as expected; after all, thematically it was a pastoral, and should begin with dawn. The sound was not quite audible, a tremulous shiver at the edge of the human auditory range, as if aspen leaves were trembling in the slightest breath of air. A sensation of floating grew steadily stronger as harmonics entered, expanded and contracted. Soon it was a rhythm these harmonics made, a slow, nearly imperceptible pulse which gradually coalesced into a two-part beat, one loud, the next soft, almost as if something were surging first forward, then back.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>It became a heartbeat. The floating continued, but began to twist in place, as if turning head downward for a plunge into depths. A green so faint it was almost black emerged, developed a fine grain which grew coarser, details struggling to sharpen. The grain spread, grew fine again, and the green faded away, replaced by the deepest red, again nearly black. The gyrations slowed further, moving upright, as if the feet were dropping slowly toward some surface. The light grew brighter.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The soft heartbeat sounds began to syncopate; now there were two such sounds, beating not quite in synchrony with one another. Another motion overlay the gyration, a rhythmic rise and fall, as of tides moving through kelp; at the same time the colors too began to pulse, lighter and darker, like walking along a row of trees with the sun behind it, light to shadow to light again.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>("It's the womb," a woman said. "Birth.")</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It was not. It was a dream of birth, a dream of the womb, dreamed out of Seemie's talent and experience. The colors faded again, the sound grew steadily louder, the heartbeats coming in and out of sync, the rise and fall, accelerating, as if the fetal audience was carried inside someone moving from a walk to a run.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>An unfocused yellow grew, drew together, shaped a sphere, began to spin. From the spinning globe trails of yellow and orange and red curled off, left behind by the fury of that turning. The trails themselves fell into themselves, formed new spheres, made planets. Not real planets, surely, but the merest suggestion of planets, the yellow sphere making the merest hint of a sun.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Something obtruded on that sun, some shadow fell between the audience and that light, and when the shadow fell, a feeling of desolation, of yearning, replaced the floating.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>There was a harsh melody then, dissonant and filled with despair; a melody with notes, phrases, intervals missing, loaded with subsonics.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>A light musical theme appeared underneath the heavy dissonance, a melodic trill. The shadow took on shape, became light green: an aspen leaf shivering against the sun. The melody gradually took over, dominated by high flute sounds, and something mellow, like an oboe. Tree trunks formed out of the darkness, the scene became an aspen grove on a mountainside. Strong sage-scent filled the air, a cool breeze moved. Suddenly it was dark again, as it was in the beginning. The heartbeats re-emerged, stronger now, with a cooler wind blowing.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Then it was cold. Light grew, a gray light, a white light, harsh and demanding, heavy cloud light and harsh ice and snow light. The heartbeats became the sound of icy waters surging against a monstrous shelf of ice. Everyone would know this was Antarctica, the cruellest place on earth.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>A reptilian head appeared over the edge of the ice, a head with a gaping mouth filled with needle teeth. The head slid forward on an endless neck, followed at last by an enormous body, spotted and fast.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The light snapped out, and the sensation was of nightmare running, frozen panic. The cold cut deeper. Everything stopped: music, heartbeat, color shaping, sensation, everything. Silence was on the face of the void.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Out of the silence the tension grew. Mouths opened to scream, but no sound came. There was nothing, absolute and without end.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It lasted until the heartbeats made their way into awareness, and with them the sudden understanding that they had been there all along. The sensation was a landmark in the void, a fulcrum around which the world could form, out of which that tremulous shiver that had begun the piece could appear, a shiver that swelled from a distant slate blue light, slowly at first, then more swiftly, until it bore down with unimaginable intensity that did not pass, but grew and grew until the light swallowed everything and was replaced by darkness.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8593">
<span>After that night Peter found something like awe had crept into his attitude toward Seemie. At the same time, though, he found himself pondering some aspects of the<i class="calibre2"> Dreamleaf</i> experience, as if something, some memory or insight, were just below the threshold of his awareness, if he could only grasp it, he would have hold of something he wanted very badly.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8594">

<div class="bs4" id="8596">
<span>He went topside to the temporary gazebo his father maintained. When Peter arrived, Seemie was asleep in a hammock strung between ancient elms whose leaves this late in the season were already an almost brownish yellow. It was Indian summer, clear and warm and dry. He watched her sleep, then sat on the lowest step of the porch.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8597">
<span>"You wanted me?" Seemie interrupted his thoughts a few minutes later. She watched him through lowered lids, still half asleep.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"Mmm." He pulled at a dried grass stalk and chewed on it thoughtfully for a moment. "You know that holo of grandmother Astora?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"She had a dream. About the Vostok Massacre."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"It could have been a coincidence, couldn't it? I mean precog dreams aren't reliable at all, since it's impossible to interpret them in advance."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"It could have been coincidence, yes. Though the details..."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Oh, sure." Peter waved his stalk in the air. "The tunnel was breached. Children froze. There was a massacre. Still, no one knows if there was one child who froze to death with a wooden stick in her hand."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"True." Seemie was sitting up now. "Go on."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Well, the question is, what material could have been authentic prophecy, and what was material from Astora's own unconscious mind?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Seemie smiled. "Is that really the question?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter looked startled. "No. You're right, that isn't the question. There was something in<i class="calibre2"> Dreamleaf</i>. Something about the way you mozart, with the probes and all that programming; something about the interaction between your mind and the AI machinery, combined with lucid dreamshaping, well, I got the idea maybe we could, well, control things."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Control things how?" Seemie was uneasy; she got out of the hammock and walked over to the elm, putting her palm against the rough bark.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I'm not sure." He frowned. "There were a lot of ancient dreams about psi effects, but at best we've developed techniques for enhanced intuition; no real power."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"You sound like you've been into the Wallace PsiLink Database."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"No!" He spoke a little too loud, and lowered his voice. "No. There were stories, old disks. Writers like Lovecraft and Heinlein, for instance, who had fantasies about such powers. I know that hundreds of years of psychic research are available in PsiLink, but I can't get in. Edmod won't let me."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"All right, Peter." Her hand reached toward him. "Your Edmod knows your personality indices. You've been raised for a math and technical niche. You'd only be distracted into a dead end by exploring Wallace."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He snorted. "Edmod's a machine!"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes, but grown for you, Peter. Adapted as closely to your DNA as a personal NP is adapted to its user's EEG. In that sense it's more than a machine."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"You don't believe that any more than I do!"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Seemie was taken aback. "How can you say that?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Because you're an artist. You shape what the machines do, not the other way around."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She laughed uneasily. "OK. True enough. What you propose then is that not only is psychic functioning real, which we already know, but that it can also be reliable?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He nodded. "And powerful. We could remake ourselves. Not just superficial stuff, like head ornamentation or gender."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Seemie winced at this reference to her mother, but said nothing.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Suddenly Peter leaned toward her and lowered his voice. "Look," he said earnestly, "there are these areas of human experience, you see? Dreams, and trance states, and what happens in the biofeedback chambers. Already we can control digestion, blood pressure, skin temperature, all that stuff. Even a techie like me can do it. How does it happen?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Peter, everyone knows it's based on quantum effects. We can do that to ourselves because we understand the mind-body interaction pretty well. But the energy expenditure is minimal, yet such things still require enormous attention and focus. To do what you're suggesting would require enormous energy output."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He threw his grass stalk away. "You don't really know what I'm suggesting," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Well, then, what..." She was interrupted by a musical tone followed by the voice of Peter's Edmod.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Peter. Please return for social training and analysis."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter pulled a wry face. "You know what that means. That means I've got to meet with my peer group and interact." He laughed. "Actually, it's kind of fun. We tell jokes."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"You tell jokes," she said, watching him go. All around her the Indian summer seemed suspended in time.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>He began to make more frequent trips topside to visit with Jimmy Radix.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>It was a strange relationship, even for those times. Jimmy Radix was over fifty, yet thought he was only twenty-three. A look in the mirror would upset him greatly, seeing as he would the deep lines along his nose and mouth, the grey hair at his temples, the faded look to his skin. He had received no longevity treatments because of his condition, nor would he. They aggravated the HMD Syndrome.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter was fifteen then, with certain aspects of his personality and intelligence indices overdeveloped.

His mind-hand slipped through hers as through a thought.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Yet she was beautiful, white of skin and pale gold of hair bound in braids above her smooth brow. He was haunted by the sadness in her face.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Does she remind you of anyone?" Edmod asked him the next day.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter frowned. "Remind me? Oh, you mean my mother. Does she look like Seemie, or act like her? I don't believe so. She doesn't feel like a reconstruction of my unconscious wishes." Edmod detected no irony in Peter's voice, but stress analysis of the sonograms shows he intended it.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He was curious, of course, and excited too. After all, Wanda Sixlove was a full-fleshed woman with a high erotic index, an object of Peter's own sexual fantasy. So he returned to her night after night, though he still didn't know whether she was a real person or a projection, nor where she was. But he began making discrete inquiries of the Quebec Warren population rolls. He guessed her age to be mid-twenties, but Quebec, of course, had no record of anyone of that age or name from the appropriate dates. So he went back.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

It's important that we keep doing this."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>A wind blew, not fast but deeply cold, like static between them, like the hydrogen hiss of the whole universe at once.

<span>I replay the records, I watch what they did: Regent Sable talked to Peter's father via a rare direct fiber holo link, a secure line. Ran was not particularly happy with the call. "It's near Christmas," he said. "I've got work to do. What do you want?"</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8668">

"She's fine, Regent. Just fine."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"And the boy?" Regent went on. "How do you find the boy these days?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Ran hesitated.

He'd need an extra session in the chamber tonight. But damn it all, Regent Sable was such a sanctimonious ass.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Just be a good father to the boy, Ran. That's all." Regent's voice poured oil on the troubled water.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It bothered Ran that Regent called Peter "the boy" all the time. He had considered Regent might be Peter's father, but for some reason he'd never bothered to have the tests done. It didn't seem important then.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Now, though, with the call, he wasn't so sure. Perhaps it was important.

For example, he's been spending time somewhere out of contact. Did you know that?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What... Oh, you mean topside. Yeah, he hangs around a pathetic vet named Radix. HMDS victim. He's harmless, really. Jazz, Regent, the man does gardening!"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"No, Ran. That's not what we're concerned about. We've been monitoring the Park. It's something else. We don't know where he goes, but he's taking time off. He's in the formative era of his career prep, Ran. We wouldn't want him to go wrong now, would we? And I have a special interest in the boy. So keep an eye on him. See if you can find out where he's going."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Sure. OK, Regent.

<div class="bs4" id="8675">
<span>UN RESOLUTION 1992: The original UN resolution of 1992 to move underground had gained uneven acceptance throughout the world. In Antarctica, for example, the movement underground was nearly universal. Elsewhere, though, only some cities were successfully dug. Cheap laser drilling power and robot heavy construction made such a move plausible and affordable, but many cultural and social reasons existed to prevent its universal adoption. Large sections of Chicago, much of Boston, Washington D.C., and Seattle remained topside. Other cities, like San Francisco, could not go underground without severe geological problems. Still others, like Moscow and New York, remained frozen in time, preserved as historic monuments, while cities like Singapore and Brasilia became heavy industry centers. Finally some, like Calcutta, were successfully moved underground.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8676">
<span>Among the most successful moves in America were the Springfields. Partly this resulted from agricultural pressure, since in the teens and twenties the land was needed for intensive farming (by the mid-21st century this was no longer a necessity); partly it was the even and controlled environment underground that made the move attractive.</span><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>Since the Springfields were among the earliest cities to dig, much of the warren complex later became obsolete, abandoned and eventually forgotten. Jimmy Radix, perhaps because he had such good memories from his own youth, had found a subcellar library and laboratory complex which was sealed off in the mid-thirties.

<span>There were seventeen people in the room: friends of Peter's like Rover and Shem, Wynders and Shelley and Scottie and Jimmy Radix.

She was the one who finally asked, "What's the one problem, Peter?"</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"The problem, Larin, is that it seems it would take the entire energy output of the sun for several days concentrated into a few hundred milliseconds.

Besides, we're not doing anything illegal—unless there's a law against thinking."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"No," she said shortly. "That's not it. The Elite Neutralization Corp watches out for dangerous new technologies, though. I hear about this stuff at home, you know. My father talks, at dinner sometimes, about things he overhears when he's on the system."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Look," Rover said. "there's nothing here. We don't have a new technology, and even if we did, we'd need a power source that doesn't exist, so they don't have to worry, right."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Nonetheless," Peter said, "I think I'll encrypt these meetings. No sense alarming the ENC over nothing." He gestured at the slowly rotating holo shape in the air beside him. "This model represents a configuration of the particle flow in a quantum transformation. On a macro level it represents a hypnagogic state. I've been having some experience with this lately, and this is the best model I've been able to devise.

<span>THE MIND WARS, February 2074, Capsule history: The Mind Wars began, as so many did in the late 21st century, as a personal vendetta between two managerial families. The Genetic Diversity Act of 2030 was still in force, but ethnic groups maintained hostilities in spite of it. Perhaps the Act made things worse; certainly the world had been on a homogenization trend for several decades before the Act passed the Council, a trend which the Act appeared to reverse.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8698">
<span>The vendetta was registered in Cyprus. It was just one of thousands of registered vendettas that winter, monitored, regulated, and refereed by Central Processing. A Greek family named Nychtides had challenged a Turkish family named Chakal ë on grounds of failure to pay bride price. In truth, the Turk had manipulated the database to squeeze out the Greek head of family from a lucrative managerial channel, and the bride-price failure was only the pro-forma excuse. Such things were common and quite legal, since minimal neurophage violence was considered a reasonable outlet and alternative to the kind of disaster the Burma War had been.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>This time something was different. The Nychtides family had developed a twist on the NP weapon that did more that produce temporary disorientation; it induced, permanently, a new form of genetic disease, a complete loss of will. Med10 named it Genetic Aboulia Disorder, for a DNA-programmed loss of will.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The Chakal ë family was quickly decimated. Unfortunately another Turk family took a hit, and declared a vendetta against the Nychtides, who retaliated in turn. Soon all Cyprus was in a state of siege, and the ENC cops were ineffective against this new weapon, which destroyed the first contingent sent in.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>No shields were effective. The war spread rapidly to widely scattered outbreaks as families here and there acquired the new technology and used it to gain temporary advantage. It flared and died down several times for the next twenty years, gradually evening out over the globe to a dull melancholy pain in the social structure.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8707">
<span>FUNERAL PRACTICES: By the late 2020s, a combination of ecological and social forces (E-cubed Society was a prime mover in this trend) had resulted in cremation and recycling as standard funeral practice. Even minor warrens had mortuary facilities for the swift reduction and capture of components. The recycled materials are not, in truth, necessary to the well-being of Intercorp society, but a strong belief system prevails that provides relief from grief reactions by assuring the continued flow of the material body in the universal dynamic.</span></div>

<span>Seemie Molay Devore died the day Regent Sable arrived in Springfield West. The life-support monitors very gradually flattened until she was gone.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8711">
<span>Her remains slid away to the flashers for recycling. The wall signaled her status: first organ salvage — kidneys, liver, spleen, pancreas, endocrine glands, pineal, pituitary, adrenals, thyroid and so forth; spinal tissue, optics, heart and lung complex; so many one-meter sections of bowel and small intestine; circulatory materials and so on for the longevity technology centers. Various compounds and essential proteins were extracted, pre-flash prep, flash dissolution, and final analysis of basic compounds. Peter and Ran watched solemnly as her container vanished from view. She produced her fair contribution to others' lives and was gone.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Ran turned away, saying nothing. Peter watched him leave the mortuary salon.

<span>GENETIC DISEASES: PROPRIOCEPTIVE DEGENERATION DISEASE</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8714">
<span>Proprioceptive Degeneration Disease (PDD), characterized by waning and eventual loss of the proprioceptive sense, which locates the human body and limbs in space. Victims are unable to locate themselves, and must live in houses filled with mirrors to provide constant visual feedback to ordinary activities. Cause of the disease is unknown, though it is grouped in the standard taxonomy of genetic diseases. First described in the mid-20th century, the disease appeared in large numbers beginning in the 2020s, and reached a proportion approaching 1000 new cases a year worldwide. The effects are irreversible. Chromosome eleven contains a genetic marker for the disease, but the exact location of the affected gene or genes seems to move at random.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8715">
<span>Theoretical treatment was through extended hibernation in the Vega starship cryofields, which accounted for the high percentage of victims among the passengers. Effectiveness of this treatment is unknown.</span><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8722">
<span>Peter shrugged. He pushed the model gently, and it floated away, turning slowly. It was a complex three dimensional structure that changed as it turned, lines and planes intersecting, flowing into one another, behind one another, through one another while changing color. Cones formed, flattened, became spheres, turned at right angles to become complex knots made of silver coils. The model stopped over the projector and froze.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"OK," he said. "The model represents what happens when two people make a psychic link in a hypnagogic state. This is a real phenomenon, which I have experienced with a rider on the Vega 26 starship."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"You're dreaming," Rover said after a silence.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter nodded. "Yes," he said. "That's it exactly. Still, it's real. I've checked the records. Her name is Wanda Sixlove, and her ship left in 2050, nine years before I was born. I learned all this from my contact with her, and then checked it out. There is no way I could have had that information before, yet the comps confirmed everything. She told me she had Proprioceptive Degeneration Disease, and that the medics thought thirty years in the freezer might cure it, so she went on a Vega flight."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I knew a PDD," one of the men said. "I never heard of that cure."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Maybe it doesn't work. There haven't been any revivers yet. But a lot of PDDs went on Wanda's ship. And she has a special skill because of it."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What's PDD?" the girl with otter fur wanted to know.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"It's a loss of all spatial sense, all the proprioceptive sensors in joints and muscles go off-line. They have to live in houses made out of mirrors for visual feedback. I wouldn't want it." The old timer leaned back and crossed his arms, looking at Jimmy.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"You wouldn't want what I got either," Jimmy said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"No, you're sure right there, my friend. I would not."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"So," Rover said, returning to the subject, "what's her special skill?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"She's used to being adrift in space," Peter replied. "It doesn't frighten her to be cut off from her body. Frankly, it scares the code right out of me."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"So what? Nobody's going to be leaving her body," Shem said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"On the contrary," Jimmy Radix said. "That's precisely what we could all do."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Except for that one little problem," Larin said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Right. Power supply," Shelley concluded.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Well, let's all think about it. Look, people used to think that certain tasks took enormous power — lifting cars above the ground, for instance. Now, liquid nitrogen vehicles use very little energy. It could be the same with this thing," Rover suggested.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter began encrypting the recordings of the meeting. "Remember," he said, pausing, "with enough power we could break through. There's another world."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We got enough trouble in this one, I think," the otter girl said, but she was grinning when she said it.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>HOMER COMMENTARY 02062106@215325</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8724">
<span>Regent Sable came again to Springfield West. Now he had company, men with hard eyes. He was angry.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8725">
<span>He noted his anger. He was angry because he was afraid. Something had slipped past the monitors, past all the regulation, the careful social control, and having slipped past, it was about to escape, and at a time when such escape would have the worst effects on the world.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Population was declining at an alarming rate. The Mind Wars were raging out of control on three continents. Human productivity was falling.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>But the one worry that overshadowed all the others was Peter Devore. Regent was reasonably certain by then that Peter was his son, yet it was even more clear that Peter was a danger, that his particular genius was taking him into areas that would better be left alone for a number of significant reasons.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It was a genius Peter got from his mother — a woman who had been growing increasingly dangerous herself, her art tending as it had toward proscribed technologies. Peter's grandmother Astora had a significant level of psychic functioning, though as always it was a useless ability.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>But it appeared that Peter was about to find a way to apply the ability.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Furthermore, Central Processing predicted, with over 73 percent confidence, that almost everyone had the ability. If it were developed, the relatively stable and peaceful structure of world society would be torn apart. Despite the Mind Wars, the world remained clean, safe, and well provided, without poverty, debilitating illness outside the genetic diseases, or oppression. Longevity technology was freely available, and barring genetic disease, a human could expect to live to at least 114.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>But a widespread psychic technology would upset all that. Results were unpredictable, but CP had 87 percent confidence that consequences would be negative. So far, Regent had been able to prevent any significant growth of this technology. He'd helped destroy PSYCHE back in '52, and as far as he knew that was the end of it. Now it seemed that Mentor, Dittmore Seminole Gadd himself, had contacted Peter through channels as yet untraced, and had pushed him into making some fundamental discoveries, and, worse, disseminating the information.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>All in all, things were not going well just now. Regent did not intend to let them remain that way.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8726">
<span>HOMER SCENE-WS/PDRef@5421</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8727">
<span>"I don't know what's making this work so well," Peter told Wanda Sixlove, "but I'm finding it easier and easier to reach and stay with you."</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8728">
<span>"We're making a connection," she said, and there was such intense passion and promise in her feeling-tone that Peter would have blushed, had he been awake.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>She danced for him, reaching to take his hand, to lead him into the slow pavane. Behind them the walls were hung with tapestries she had woven through the long weary years of her voyage in the cold, tapestries in which the unicorn turned at bay, and the damsel was seated on the forest floor with the noble head in her lap, and the hunters called in the distance as the dogs came close. Overhead the leaves hung down, close and dense, holding them as they walked slowly, hands together and arched, looking into one another's eyes.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Wanda's eyes were violet, he thought, of a twilight clarity. Is this love? he wondered, thinking she was ten years his senior and altogether wiser in the world.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>But no, she said to him. I am frozen in time as I hurtle through space, while you grow. Soon you will be the older. By the time I arrive at Beta, you will be the older.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Oh, Weaving Girl," Peter said, with such despair. They danced.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>Peter's group began to move. Within minutes their room was closed, locked, and restored, as if it had been abandoned for many years. Regent Sable and his two searchers passed it on their second sweep of the area.</span></div>

<span>"What makes you think they're down here, Hoskins?" Regent asked. His voice echoed in the empty metal hallways.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8734">
<span>"We've had a lot of experience with these types," the ENC sergeant answered. "There're always malcontents. There were malcontents before the Elite Neutralization Corps signed a contract with the old United Nations, and there are still malcontents. With tracking and projection programs, we've managed to keep them pretty well contained, but they crop up now and then. Nothing to worry about; we'll find 'em. These older warrens aren't well mapped, and we have to go through them foot by foot. But we'll find 'em."</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"What makes you think they're malcontents?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Something about Sable's tone made the sergeant straighten an extra fraction. "They wouldn't be hiding if they weren't. Sir."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"No," Sable murmured as he checked his bloodhound chemosensor. "I suppose not. I don't think this thing's working."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Why's that? Sir." Sergeant Hoskins looked over his shoulder at the device.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Because it records nothing for this area. No one has passed this way within the time range of the bloodhound. Not a trace of organics more recent than twelve years ago. We'd better head back up a level."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8736">
<span>"The effects are getting more predictable," Peter was saying. "I can control when and where. I can direct the fantasy, although not alone — Wanda and I have to agree on it. She is an incredibly strong, brave person. She's done things I have trouble imagining myself doing. Someday, perhaps... Anyway, the technique is feasible. We still don't have a power source, though, and I see no possibility of getting one. So what we're onto is still just a possibility."</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8737">
<span>"There's nothing in local space with that kind of power output," Rover said. "And even if there were, how could we control it?"</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"We either keep thinking," Peter began, "or we..."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He was interrupted by a soft chime from a personal autosentry module he'd dropped in the corridor two levels below the Recreation Complex. A holo formed in the air.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Who the hell is that?" Shem asked. Three men were moving through the corridors, obviously making a careful search of the subcellars.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter queried the module, which responded with a negative color. If he wanted an ID, he'd have to query Chicago Node directly. "Somehow I don't think Chicago Node'll tell us," Peter said. "But those two in back are pretty obviously Elite Neutralization Corps cops, right, Larin?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She laughed. "By the look of them, I'd say yes."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Then we'd better close down here. Just in case they're looking for us, we might as well be clean."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8739">
<span>"Something is very seriously wrong," Sable said, two hours later.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8740">
<span>"Yes, sir," the ENC sergeant said. "But we've got a lot on our hands right now. Fighting broke out in St. Louis, Denver and Little Rock Warrens. Casualties are unacceptably high, and almost all available resources have been diverted to those regions. Ed — Corporal Denz — and I are the only personnel you can have right now. I'm sorry."</span><p class="calibre1"><span>They had appropriated an office in the Springfield West Arcology tower, on the eightieth floor. There was some inconvenience in terms of distance and transportation, but they'd also appropriated an exclusive lift for their work, and the advantages of safety, observation and access to the Worldnet outweighed the disadvantages. Besides, the room had a real window.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"In that case, Sergeant, I think we'd better quit screwing around. CP has done serious projections on this potential technique of Devore's, and it looks like a Code Eleven crisis. With the wars going on, we don't have much time for niceties. I want you to go ahead and round them up — Devore, Radix, any others you can find."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes, sir! Do I have full discretion?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Full discretion, Sergeant. Find them and bring them here."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes, sir." The two ENC cops turned and walked out of the office.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>Jimmy Radix sat in the green light of the holo scanners. Somewhere in a far darkness Regent Sable wanted to know things. Jimmy wanted to help, but somehow he didn't seem to know the right answers.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8743">
<span>"Who are you?" Regent asked; his voice came out of the amplifiers subtly distorted with persuasive overtones, with Jimmy's acoustic pressure points precisely targeted.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Jimmy looked up. "I know that one," he said, smiling broadly. "I'm Jimmy Radix."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"How old are you, Jimmy?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Twenty-three. I'm twenty-three."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Take a look, Jimmy."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>A silvered oval appeared in the air. Jimmy looked at the surface, and saw his reflection there. "Who's that?" Jimmy asked.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"That's you, Jimmy. That's a reflector in front of you. You're looking at yourself. Does that look like a twenty-three year old man, Jimmy?" A subsonic persuader was added to the voice at this point, but already Jimmy's vital signs were surging upward — heartbeat, respiration, adrenalin, serotonin and melatonin balances. He went into subtle anaphylactic shock.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"No," he said, holding up his hands. "No! That's not me! I'm young." He began to cry.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"No, Jimmy!" Sable's voice snapped out of the dark.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Strange indefinite reddish shapes twisted in that darkness as Sable moved. The shapes were frightening, ominous, keyed to Jimmy's fears. He couldn't speak for some moments, the nameless dread was on him so. "I...I'm not..."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Do you know Peter Devore?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Jimmy Radix shook his head. "No. No, I don't know, I don't..."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Peter Devore, Jimmy. He's your friend. He gave you something, didn't he? A custom chip, just for you, isn't that right?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Jimmy shook his head back and forth, back and forth. "No...no...no."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Where is that chip, now, Jimmy? Where's your personal monitor?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Personal...? I don't have one. What's a personal monitor?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Sergeant Hoskins appeared in the green holo projection light like a human shape taking form in smoke. "Mr. Sable wants to know where your monitor is, Mr. Radix. Mr. Sable is a reasonable man, but he needs to know."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I want to tell him, I do." Jimmy looked up hopefully; his eyes were filled with pain. "But I don't know."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Look at your wrist. See the pale spot where the tan stops. That's where your personal monitor should be. It was there until very recently. You led us on a merry chase; a merry chase. Somewhere you ditched your monitor. Three days, Mr. Radix, we've been after you. Where did you go?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I don't... I don't understand..." Jimmy looked around wildly.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What's the read, Denz?" Sable called.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>A circuit clicked on. "Negative, sir," Denz' voice came out of the darkness. "There's a faint trace on the interpersonal index keyed to Peter's name. You might try that once more. We have a complete read on the subject now."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Right." The circuit clicked off. "All right, Jimmy," Sable said. His voice was calm, reasonable, persuasive. The full power of electronic and subsonic vocal manipulators were in effect. "About your friend Peter. Do you know where he is, now?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Peter? Peter's all right. He's all right, isn't he? He's going to...do something."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes, Jimmy. That's very good. He's going to do something, isn't he? He's going to give it to everyone, isn't he?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Give it to everyone. Yes, yes. He's going to give it away. For everyone. He said... he said it would make us all..." He stopped.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Make us all what, Jimmy?" Sable leaned forward in the dark red light. "Make us all...free?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The circuit clicked on. "Sir, the readings are all over the place. You'd almost think he'd been hit with a mind bomb. Stop him."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The lights snapped on. Jimmy slumped in his chair. "Peter," he mumbled. "Peter's gone. He's gone. Goodbye Peter," he looked up one last time and smiled. "You can't fool me," he said. "I'm young."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>
