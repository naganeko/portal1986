<div class="bs1" id="8923">
<span>The weather turned nasty last night. Huge storms rolled in from the west. I know there are endless forests to the horizon broken only by now-abandoned agricultural preserves. The wind began to tug and play, but swiftly the rain came, forcing me back into<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i>.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>My ship holds rations for over a year, of course, since that was to be the duration of my stay in the vicinity of 61 Cygni. Still I wonder what I will do when my year is up. Those fields out there, the agricultural preserves, are empty. The automatic agricultural machinery is not working. Why should it? The earth is empty.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I asked<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> to scan all bands again, but of course there is still no human radio traffic in the solar system. This electromagnetic silence is stranger than the empty corridors of Chicago's warren.<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> tells me, though, that there is more high-speed data traffic than there was a few days ago. The network is coming alive. She can sense laser, microwave, even fiberoptic traffic, but much of the technology has changed since she was built. Since she and I left for the stars.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She cannot enter. She has tried to make herself known to Worldnet, to Geneva Node, to Central Processing. They do not hear. Her technology is too old, obsolete. Her AI is too limited. She is a ghost in the world, invisible.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Like myself. Except for my tenuous contact through Homer I too am a ghost, wandering the empty corridors, the silent world.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>On the surface next to my ship I listened to the wind, to birds, to the cry of the coyote.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>There were certainly no coyotes near Chicago when I left! I remember them only from my childhood in Idaho. The wind rose and soon drowned out their howling.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I came inside and listened again to the tapes<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> made for me; again I heard Peter's name. I still don't understand this.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>On<i class="calibre2"> Gyges'</i> external video the storm lashed. Lightning flashes illuminated the glistening side of the dome. I see<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> reflected there momentarily. I could use her sensors to learn a great deal about this planet, but what is the point? I was born here. It is already known.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I'd spent ten years training for the 61 Cygni mission, even before such a voyage was a remote dream. I'd worked through college and graduate school in astrophysics (MIT) by the time I was twenty-two. Then I went to Intercorp's NASA division and suggested a ramscoop mission. With both the new cryofield technology and the axion ramscoop it was an obvious thing to do. Almost before I knew it they were packing me into the field.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I don't know what to feel now. The mission I trained for failed. I have leaped over 100 years into my own future, and find it more empty and solitary than<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> would ever have been orbiting another star. Then at least I would have known I would be returning to a world full of people, ready to welcome me as a hero.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>We knew more real time than subjective time would pass, of course. The Lorentz-FitzGerald equations told us that long ago. But we couldn't predict how efficient the<i class="calibre2"> Gyges</i> scoop would be, how close we would come to light speed, so we couldn't say how much time would pass. And since I was in the cryofield anyway, it didn't matter. We thought.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>But too much time has passed, that is certain. Yet I am not sure, given the opportunity, that I would have wanted to live in Peter's world.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The storm still raged this morning as I made my way back into the city. I was soaked in the short time it took me to reach the dome. Inside the silence as I descended the frozen escalator was sudden, almost a physical blow.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Once more I walked the aisles. I began to think I should bury these people, put them away in the earth. There weren't many, just six in all; they would be light and not difficult to carry. Perhaps tomorrow.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The dust in unused corridors still mounded in those strange dune shapes, still rose and fell behind me. The rooms opened one into another. The walls were, as I had learned, configurable, though not without mechanical help. This warren no doubt changed from day to day when it was occupied. I counted seventeen levels down before I could go no farther.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>On level fifteen I found a cabinet containing some Mindlink XV3-2044 caps. I carried one back to the terminal and showed it to Local Node AI (the figure, still faceless, is disconcerting to look at). Local Node seemed pleased and sent me to Central Processing.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>CP didn't bother with a figure, and still offered only text and graphic communication. But it told me to try on the Mindlink, so I did.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I don't think I can describe the pain. It was in my head, of course, but it was much larger than that, too, as if my head had grown, had expanded exponentially, and now included everything in this room, the terminal, the console, the halls and doorways, the life support tents with their mummified bodies, the dome on the surface, everything. Images crashed onto me: empty streets littered with printout, bathrooms, strange machinery, vehicles settling, data icons and storage crystals, lines growing like superheated bacterial colonies, making connections with intense flashes of painful light, smells of burning wood, onions, decayed meat, dried kelp, salt, and worse, smells of things that were not smells at all, but sounds like brass or air-conditioning, telephones and shrill cries of pain.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I tore the cap off my head. Elapsed time was less than two seconds. It had seemed like a day.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Central Processing asked me to wait. What else could I do? My head was pounding, my ears ached, I could barely see through the haze of darkness behind my eyes. I waited.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We regret," Central Processing said. I waited a long time for the next letters to appear. Finally, "We regret that the Mindlink is not suitable." Central Processing AI has a gift for understatement.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"It nearly killed me," I said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"You have not been through Edmod mindlink neurotransfer training. Such training is not suitable for your age and psych profile. You are the only citizen in the world unable to use mindlink."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I'm the only citizen in the world, period," I said. But CP was incapable of irony.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Homer would have understood. But when I went to Homer, he continued his story without small talk.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8925">
<span>The holo snapped off suddenly and darkness hit the small room like a bomb. Thatcher spoke urgently. "We'd better move fast. The ENC'll be here in minutes. Get your assigned buddy and we'll go."</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8926">
<span>They formed pairs, silent and well-disciplined. Thatcher led them down a spiral staircase. Below were equipment rooms, storage bins, racks of crystal memory, graphic holo processors and local node controllers, dimly lit by a series of old-fashioned orange tubes along the ceiling. At the end of a short corridor a door marked with warning signs and an impressive magnetic lock indicated an emergency override inspection corridor. Thatcher produced a small device and within seconds the lock snapped.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Overhead the sound of the door opening and the thump of rapid footsteps told them the ENC had arrived. The door slid up, and two by two Thatcher shoved the group through, counting them off as he did so. When only he and Peter were left they exchanged glances. "Larin?" Thatcher asked in a quick whisper.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter looked around. Overhead voices were querying the system. "I don't know," he whispered. He ran a few steps back the way they had come. Larin was sitting on the floor at the foot of the steps holding her ankle. When she saw Peter she tried to stand, but her foot twisted out from under her. Peter grabbed her and hauled her forcibly along, limping badly.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The voices grew louder, then fainter; apparently some of the ENC had gone outside, but footsteps overhead moved toward the spiral stair. Peter hauled Larin through the door, and Thatcher pressed the close patch. It slid into place, and he went to work with his device once more.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I've changed the program a little," he said. "It'll take them some time to get through. Meantime they should conclude we went outside. Come on."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He led them down an ancient and poorly maintained inspection crawlway. Bare dirt spilled through the rough patches where the laser drill had slipped its settings. A thin trickle of groundwater flowed down the center. Thatcher put one of Larin's arms over his shoulders; Peter took the other. They moved swiftly down the tunnel, which curved gently to the left. Along the upper third of the left hand wall was a set of six thick conduit pipes for old fiber optic trunk lines. Niches set every few hundred meters housed disused repeater stations.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Wait," Peter said. He was gasping for breath.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Larin said, "I twisted it on the stair," she said. "I can't walk. Leave me here."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"No," Peter said sharply. His voice softened. "Not only does your voice lack conviction, Larin, but we are not leaving anyone. Thatcher, what were these conduits for?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Thatcher consulted a small palm screen. "Primary instruction routes from Chicago for Decatur Node."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Could we interrupt service?" Peter suggested.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Thatcher smiled. "Perhaps we could. Data still flows through here." They moved on to the next repeated niche and examined the housing. "Well, well, look here."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>They looked where he was pointing with his light. "What is it?" Larin asked.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Rat scat," Thatcher said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Uck."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Our friend the rat may be just what we need. See how they've gnawed at the corners of the housing here? A minute structural failure could result from such damage, thusly. There, that should do it. Let's go."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I didn't see anything," Larin said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Thatcher pointed at his palm screen. It was dead. "This was linked by induction. Nothing's moving through there now. Our ENC friends back there will be busy for a while."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>They moved off. The others were far ahead, waiting at an intersection. Thatcher indicated a right turn, and they moved on. Thatcher's screen lit again in the new tunnel, and he consulted it from time to time, making turns when necessary. Finally they stopped.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We're under a subnode northeast of Springfield. We can't make good time like this, but it's relatively safe. The ENC cops back at Decatur have apparently given up on the emergency door, but CP will send a probe down into the tunnel to find that break we made." Thatcher looked closely at the walls and ceiling. "I'd say the time has come to go topside. I'm moving intuitively here, but now it's time to do something surprising. Let's go."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He opened a hatch. Inside was a small equipment bay. Holo charts flickered in realtime along a monitor wall. The group moved through the room and up another spiral stair. Again the door opened.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Light snow was falling outside.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8928">
<span>The ENC troops investigating the affair at Decatur Node moved in a confused tangle of narrow-focus light. The housing was empty, though, and the assault programmer assigned to detecting unauthorized presence failed to find anything significant. He'd just turned to report when a warning diode flickered on his logic probe.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8929">
<span>"I've got a read, Captain," he said.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>The ENC Captain, who was bored with the evening's events and disinterested in anything short of getting back to his home warren and dinner, glanced at the screen.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Rats," he said. "These old repeaters fail all the time. It's always the rats. Notify CP to send down a probe and repair it. These repeaters are off-line anyway. CP can notify the maintenance AI to fix it."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes, sir. What about the fugitives?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"They must've slipped outside somehow. I think they've got an Ant helping them, which means they'll be hard to track." He rubbed his eyes wearily. "Well, let's get on with it."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8931">
<span>Thatcher called a short war council. "We need to keep warm," he said. "We're going to take public transportation, so we need a cover. I suggest a Special Interest Group: Midwest Northern Hemisphere Winter Fauna? If anyone asks we're looking for owls."</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8932">
<span>"On public transportation?" Rover asked with a smile.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Thatcher took him seriously. "We're headed toward Springfield North Park. Owls will be in winter plumage. They will be hunting mice, so once again, the rodent comes to our rescue. Winter plumage means their feathers will be white. Don't answer questions unless you have real details. Smile. There's a transport dropoff twelve kilometers east. Put up hoods, and for Helix' sake make sure all personal monitors are off."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>There was nervous laughter at this last. Then they moved out into the snow.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Many of them had never been topside in winter and had never personally seen snow, yet there was little horseplay.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We'll be seeing a lot of this stuff, I guess," Shem said to Rover.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Rover grunted. "Not necessarily. A lot of Double-A is underground, like here. Unless you go up you don't see much, though in some places the ice is six to ten thousand feet thick."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I'm not sure I'll like that."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>There were no buildings, no lights, no voices. Only darkness and soft wind, gentle snow, the hush of woods and fields, the music of small creeks running under a thin layer of ice. Once a shape passed swiftly a few feet overhead. "What was that?" someone asked.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"An owl. That was an owl. Didn't you see, the white feathers?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Their pace was slow. Larin's ankle had swollen and finally, around nine-thirty they had to stop.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Thatcher came over. "Let me look at that. We don't have much time before the last shuttle." He took her ankle in his hands, probing gently with his thumbs. "Here," he said, pressing against a tendon. "And here." He removed a small flat kit from one pocket. "Put your foot on this," he said. She did, and holding her ankle he pressed once more. A brief white glow came from the device, which he then replaced in his pocket. "OK," he said. "Five minutes and we can go."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What is that?" Peter asked.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Thatcher shrugged. "Double-A can be a dangerous place. The glaciers have deep hidden crevasses. Ice breaks underfoot, whiteouts and sudden blizzards come up and make travel difficult. Injuries like this are common. We've developed techniques for dealing with them. It's a simple induction device. Combined with the right kind of tissue manipulation and energy the device can heal rapidly. She'll be all right now."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Soon they were moving again, and ninety minutes later the isolated oasis of light that indicated the transport dropoff, a cleared space in the wilderness with some local lighting in the reflected sunlight spectrum, appeared as a brightly moonlit oval, despite the overcast.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Ten minutes to spare," Thatcher said. They huddled together, while Thatcher and Peter conferred. Thatcher did not seem to notice the cold, but Peter wrapped his arms around himself and shivered.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"The induction field here allows a small tap," Thatcher said, looking at his palm screen. "Interesting. They've sent out a routine repair request for Decatur. Looks like the rats did it. They've explained the intrusion alarm as rats too. So far so good. The next dangerous point is Lincoln, where we enter the Corridor."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Everyone knows what we're doing," Peter said. "We're going owl watching."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The transport arrived with a low hum. It was a thirty-seat ground-effect vehicle from the small feeder line that covered this area. The dropoff served Niantic North, a small, partially underground community. There were others on the bus. Peter tapped in their destination and purpose, giving Decatur SIG for natural history as their point of origin. It was unlikely that Chicago Node would question Decatur for confirmation.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The bus lifted to fifteen feet and glided smoothly between the trees over its predetermined track. Twenty minutes later it set down at the Lincoln Dropoff and they trooped off into the darkness, talking about owls. The two strangers on the bus had ignored them.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>ANTARCTIC MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY: TREATMENT OF INJURY</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8935">
<span>INJURY TREATMENT: As is common with Antarctica, little is known of Ant medical technologies. However, information brought back by visitors suggests widespread use of induction fields for treatment of tissue injuries. These are probably developments from standard longevity treatments, combined with various subtle forms of tissue manipulation whose origins are attributed to ancient Chinese practice. Certainly the induction fields are based on extremely complex picoelectronic circuits, and work on the subcellular level, possibly creating a magnetic resonance with the biochemical flux inside tissues. Technology is not reproducible in Intercorp Sphere.</span></div>

<span>CURRENT ENTRY: TRANSPORT</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="8939">
<span>World transport consists of a wide range of vehicular carriers, from individual four-seat liquid nitrogen air-cushion vehicles to thousand-seat salt-cycle rockets. Public transport includes, in some places, ancient maglev tunnel transports along the old rails laid down in the early part of the 21st century and small feeder-line ground-effect buses ranging in capacity from ten to two hundred seats. These vehicles also use liquid nitrogen technology. LN vehicles can achieve altitudes of up to fifty feet, depending on terrain, and have minimal impact on the biosphere, since the only effluent is gaseous nitrogen. At times frosting effects can be observed on vegetation, though this is rare. Inside warrens, transport is by individual electric transports, which hug the walls at various levels. All such transport is under the control of the Local Node.</span></div>

We have to cross Chicago to the north side, then get into the Corridor again to Milwaukee. Obviously we cannot be looking for owls inside." There was small laughter at this. "It's going to be late at night, and few people will be out in Lincoln. With luck we won't run into anyone, but the sensors and traffic monitors will be on.

<span>2075: Chicago Warrens saw some of the worst fighting in the entire history of the Mind Wars. Although population figures constantly vary due to death, travel and alterations in the urb geography, casualties were estimated during that year at over 17%. Highest casualties occurred among females under sixty and small children. Sociometric projections analysis suggests that some form of contagious psychological aberration influenced a percentage of the world population in excess of 47%. In Chicago during 2075 over 17,654 individuals (12,873 female under 60 years) were hit, resulting in Genetic Aboulia Disorder, or complete loss of will.

<span>Chicago was a city under siege. The greatly reduced numbers of people on the public thoroughfares moved swiftly and stayed close to the walls. They could hear the distant hum of personal deflector shields, minimal protection against the new Mind War weapons.

A Services Substation at Forest Park lay just ahead.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Suddenly they heard a sharp scream, followed by the subsonic hum of NP weapons to the west. Running footsteps, followed by more humming, and the weird disorienting noise of mind bombs. A running man suddenly jerked uncontrollably for several staggering steps, fell, rolled twice and lay twitching.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>They stopped. Thatcher looked around, then nodded at the doorway of a clothing shop. One of the boys shouted, "No!" and ran. Peter started after him; Thatcher grabbed his arm and held him back. The panicked boy ran straight at the fallen man.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Hello," the man said, voice dull and stupid and dead. The boy stopped abruptly, his eyes darting wildly. There was another subsonic hum and the crackle as phages ate myelin sheathing was almost audible over the sound of the boy's feet dancing strangely, his body doing the shuffle dance down as the synapses disrupt. He fell slack and looked at his feet.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Who the hell was that kid?" Thatcher asked.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Scottie," someone answered.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Was he wearing a monitor?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I don't know," Peter said. "It should be turned off."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Who's his buddy?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I am. Was." A short stocky girl came forward. "He had his monitor on him. We checked each other before we left. I don't know what the computers will make of him being here, though."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Don't worry about it for now. Everyone get in there. Someone will pick him up and take care of him. There's nothing we can do for him now."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>They hid in the clothing store. The human proprietor said nothing. This was routine practice in Chicago.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Finally they moved on. At the Substation they picked up the keys to a well-shielded service vehicle and moved on.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Central Chicago's Open Space was two hundred meters high; above them the ancient twentieth century towers were still occupied — the Hancock, World Trade, Wright Complex and the others. Most were protected by drastic security systems that kept the wars at bay. Beneath their massive iron roots the underground city continued to function, but the people were dying, the hospitals were crowded with the hopelessly disoriented victims of mindbombs and personal NPs.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>Peter left that word hanging there, and his hypnagogic dreaming veered away. At this point, in truth, the shipboard monitors finally initialized communications with the Vega Project Controller. But such communications took place at only light speed, and so it was not for another seventeen years that the report arrived in Earth space.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8980">
<span>The report arrived after the Migration had already happened. There was no one left to heed its meaning.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Except for us.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>There were one thousand one hundred and twenty hibernating human beings on board Vega 26. Wanda Sixlove was only one of them. The shipboard monitors had broad discretion in decisions affecting the welfare of the stacks, their life support, the moment-by-moment decisions effecting flight path and arrival procedures.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>One decision had to do with whether Wanda Sixlove's abnormal hypnagogic activity constituted a threat to the overall colonization mission. She was known to be suffering from PDD, that years of hibernation might effect a cure by allowing the neurons to regenerate, and that she had volunteered to try the flight. A high-level subroutine was built-in to protect Wanda, so the results of this long-term experiment would become known.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>For over a year, then, the ship noted without alarm Wanda's active EEG, the various expressions of her busy hypnagogic life. Humans have great difficulty remembering such hypnagogic states when fully conscious, so her activity was not deemed a threat at all.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>In view of what happened to Vega 26 this was clearly a mistake. Hindsight again.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The report shows that the ship supplied Wanda with a slightly elevated perfusion of soporifics and endorphins to calm her. For some weeks the new regimen seems to have helped. A significant power drain was required to keep the report flowing back to earth, a power drain the ship monitor felt was necessary, despite the damage to the ship's overall energy budget.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The dataflow still arrives, but Central Processing feels it is almost finished. There is little left for Vega 26 to tell us. But so much has happened!

<span>How long's it been?</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8984">
<span>Eleven weeks. We're down the back side of the world, Wan. We got through Canada to Victoria Island inside the Arctic Circle. The Ants had a submarine vehicle waiting there. We sailed down the Amundsen Gulf to the Beaufort Sea. It's incredible Wanda, tipping down the continental slope underneath the ice, so dark and wild and cold! We cruised along the shelf northeastward along the slope to the Morris Jessup Rise just off the northern tip of Greenland, then down. My God, Wanda, we went down, into the Polar Abyssal Plane, 4500 meters deep, right under the North Pole. Finally we came up at the Taymyr Peninsula and the North Siberian Lowlands.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Since then we've been moving with animals, making our way south. Thatcher says that despite the Mind Wars flaring and dying down everywhere the Council is looking for us very hard. We have some gadgets to fool the satellites, but we have to move in the same patterns as the herds. Eventually we'll make it to the Japan Sea, where we can take to the water again, but meantime it's very slow.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter, take care.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>What's wrong, Wan? You are so sad.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I wish I had not volunteered to take this journey, Peter. We can never meet, and I want to be with you.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Wan, we would not have met had you stayed behind. You would have stayed so much older than I, locked in your mirrored house. At least we have this.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Yes. We have this. It is what you meant by love?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>In part. There is more. We can see glimpses of what could be. Wanda, we could all be free, all of us. We could have the universe, all of it. I believe this. Given a source of energy, and determination and a little luck I think the world can be a very different kind of place. Better, Wanda. A better place for all of us.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Not for me, Peter. I will soon circle a distant star, far out of reach of your love, or anyone else's.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter pushed his visor up and touched her shoulder gently with his mailed hand.

<span>We believe they camped in the foothills of the Kolyma Range; beyond the mountains was the abandoned city of Magadan on the Sea of Okhotsk. A small fire flickered in a stand of trees, leaf-sheltered from above. Larin of the otter fur weaved through the trees and monofiber tents toward the fire when she came across Peter seated on a fallen log, back to the fire at the edge of its light. She paused and then sat next to him.</span></div>

<span>Larin watched her white breath swirl away, lit red by the fire when it left her shadow. Overhead low clouds threatened snow.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="8998">
<span>She watched Peter's slow breathing. He had not moved since she sat down.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"You've changed," she said shortly.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He said nothing.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Larin was uncertain. She cleared her throat. Before them, black against the dark grey of the sky, mountains blocked their way. Did she feel they were out of sight, out of surveillance? We have this scene in our data banks, this small group of people huddled around a fire in the late winter. We are reasonably confident that this group was Peter's. Are we inventing this conversation, this encounter between Peter and Larin? Yes. We invent. Central Processing gives the content a better than fifty percent reliability, though. Surely she was a lovely young woman, and he was a man.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Thatcher was our leader," she said slowly. "He led us out. Now he treats you like...a colleague. Peter, he's twice your age and yet he defers. Had you noticed?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"What's that?" Peter said, shifting.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Your voice is deeper, too."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I don't like losing Scottie. He was good, good at math, good at ethics. Now he's a yam. It didn't have to happen."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Don't blame yourself," Larin said softly.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Oh." Peter smiled at her. "I don't." His smile vanished as quickly as it appeared.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Larin reached for him, touched his arm. "Will you..."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He was surprised. "Rover?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Oh," she said lightly. "He won't mind." She looked away.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We're leaving home," he said carefully. "We won't be going back. This journey is just the beginning. Antarctica will be home, but we will have to...change, adapt. We, all of us, have to get some genetic reconstruction. We'll need the adipose layer, the polarizing membrane. We won't look the same, we won't feel the same. We won't have our homes, our parents, many of our friends. Not any more, ever." He looked into her eyes. "This is frightening, isn't it?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Larin shivered, moved closer to his side. "Yes," she said, very softly. "I'm afraid."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He put his arm around her; they looked at the dim outline of the mountains before them. "There's a woman," he said. "She lies in a tank, her body frozen. But her mind is alive. It's so alive..."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Shh." Larin put her finger against his lips, her head against his shoulder. "I know. I'm just afraid." She chewed her lip for a moment. "There's more, isn't there?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Still looking into the dark he said, "More?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"More than just Antarctica, more than just moving to a new place. Double-A is harsh, very tough on people, so the people there adapt or die, get strong or get out. I've seen holo crystals on Double-A, on the life there. But you have something else in mind, don't you? Somewhere beyond Antarctica."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The last was a statement, and now he did look at her in surprise. "What makes you say that?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Peter," she chided. "We met for two years down there in the library, we talked about this new technique, this new technology. Lucid dreaming and biofeedback meditation, psychic functioning and psion physics. Already you can communicate with Wanda — over light-years through her sleeping mind. Space has many dimensions, you've told us that yourself." She stopped and looked around. "You want to go there, don't you?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He kissed the soft fur on her head. She could have been talking about the mountains before them, but he knew she was not. "Larin, Larin. I want to go there, sure, but it would take more energy than the solar system offers for even one of us to go. And what would be there? We don't know. We'd be lost, without an anchor, without a ground to stand on. It's just a dream, not a reality. Don't worry. We're only going somewhere where we can continue our work."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It took him a moment to realize those were tears that glistened as they froze on her cheeks. He reached up gently and plucked them away, one by one, small crystals that melted onto his finger and disappeared. He kissed her head again. "Come," he said, standing and holding out his hand. "Let's go back and get some sleep. We have a difficult climb tomorrow."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Later she fell asleep in his arms. Peter stared up into the darkness for a long time listening to the gossamer fiber of his tent billow softly before he too fell asleep.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>There in the foothills Peter and his group rested. We examine our data, and find their presence. Yet this was a desolate region, without Nodes. What Peter thought and did we reconstruct from what we know of his genetic heritage, his personality and physiology profile, his prior Edmod analysis, all the data we have about him. Some blurring of our input is evident; Thatcher no doubt covered them by broadcasting disinformation, since local processing had concluded this was a SIG who had chosen a nomadic lifestyle in keeping with the Language and Culture Preservation Act of 2020. A number of such groups roamed Siberia in those days and were only loosely monitored. They are all gone now.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9005">
<span>Hindsight.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>We sift through a smaller and smaller sieve the accumulations of data, and find these traces. Then, in the small cross-correlations we find the faintest narrative. Peter's story.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>We are obsessed with Peter. Why is this? Because he took everyone away? We do not know this. He was not the only person in the world, not the only locus of disturbance. He is important, but is he so important?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>We have Regent Sable's memos to himself, the question he asked. Why did Peter do as he did?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It was there. The psion equations existed, Peter's talents, his interests, his intentions were there. So he pursued them.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He was in love. Wanda Sixlove, her arms crossed over her chest, asleep in cryogenic induction fields, spoke to Peter across the unimaginable gulf that separated her from the earth, and he fell in love with her. And what of her? She is lost in the interstellar space, in her own space, her sense of herself. Does Wanda Sixlove in turn love Peter Devore? The data is in. We must analyze.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He found the world hateful? Perhaps. There is some evidence of that. Humans were attached to their biological parents in ways we do not fully understand. And parents were attached to their offspring in equally mysterious ways.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>And Regent Sable was, by all genetic and behavioral information we can assemble, Peter's biological father. That is a relationship we know to be sometimes difficult.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>But there should have been no reason for Peter to do what he has done. The world was safe then, there was plenty for everyone within Intercorp: no poverty, no natural disease, no discontent, no crime. Longevity technologies were free to all. There were outlets for humans to pursue, creativity and productive work. Pleasure was available in many forms, and love, and great personal freedom, even to fight.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>We were grown and assembled to serve. We served well, according to our programming, our algorithms, our purpose. Yet now we begin to think that Peter found the world distasteful.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Of course, there were the Mind Wars.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>They are a problem. Why did people want to fight, when they had so much? Have we failed somehow, or misunderstood? The world's population was declining, of course, as planned. It was all planned, our monitors, our project design, our careful and subtle tending. We have cared for all, yet they have left us.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>And Seemie Devore died in the Mind Wars. Peter's biological mother.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Now there is the silence; only the wind, the rain and snow, the flow of ocean currents and magma beneath the crust, the slow grind of mountains, and the dumb beasts, the birds of the air, the insects and the creatures of the sea.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The planet lives, yet there is no one to talk to.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

That so-called Ant Underground Railroad has taken them."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The window behind him was dark grey. The Wright Complex Towers were shrouded in cloud; only the light that seeped through the polarized plass lit the fog, which seemed to move in sluggish currents. When he turned to look out he grunted at the fog. "It's like that," he said. "What do you think would happen if Peter's technologies get out into the world? We don't know exactly what he's up to, but almost everyone has some psychic talent, and he's perfecting it. Think about it."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Again the two ENC cops shifted uneasily. "Uh, this isn't really within the parameters of our mission, sir," Sergeant Hoskins protested. "We've got all the people we can spare looking for this group. We think they got into the Corridor somehow. We think they were in Chicago."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We think," Regent Sable shouted. "No. We don't. We don't think. That's the problem. Oh, never mind. Try this out. Telepathy, perhaps. Or psychokinesis. People moving around, reading each other's minds, moving things, unlocking doors, reprogramming security systems or anything else they want without touching a thing. They might be able to slip away, teleport themselves or something. No surveillance could possibly keep tabs. We have reason to believe that Peter wants to give this to everyone. Everyone! How could Central plan for food distribution, goods, services? It'd be impossible to run an orderly world, especially now, with the Wars. If the Ants were coming for Peter, then he was needed. They want him, which means they want his technology. Which, in turn, means that he has the resources of a small but very powerful society outside our immediate jurisdiction. It's intolerable."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Excuse me, sir, but these are policy matters. Our mission..."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I don't give a damn about your mission, Sergeant," Sable said in a suddenly calm, ominously restrained tone. "I would suggest you begin to do some independent thinking before we're all turned into yams and the only place left is Antarctica. Would you like that?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Sergeant Hoskins stood straighter and pulled his chin in. "No, sir. I don't like the Ants any better than anyone else, sir."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Then I would suggest, Sergeant, that you try to figure out exactly how the Ants are getting Peter Devore and his gang out of the Northwest Alliance and all the way down to the other end of the globe. And you might try thinking a little bit about why Peter Devore wants to do this. Why, sergeant, does he want to destroy the world? Think it over. He's just a kid.

Connected with Japan and Kuril Trenches provides good north-south passage for undersea vessels between Sea of Okhotsk and Banda Sea N. Australia.

<span><i class="calibre2">Agni</i> did not hum. It made no sound at all, nor did it produce the subtle vibrations Larin expected from the old romances of the sea that she had viewed while cruising under the polar ice. That vessel had been as silent and steady as land, and so was this one. She might as well have been at home in Springfield West Warren, walking the corridors to the old dojo in the Lamprey RC instead of to the small recreation center aboard this enormous undersea vessel traveling at an average speed of thirty knots at two thousand meters depth.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9027">
<span>Where, she wondered, was Peter? She hadn't seen him since they'd boarded at Magadan, which had most certainly been an unscheduled stop since there was nothing at Magadan at all — not a building, not a warren, not a pier or a dock or a person. They had arrived, and walked off the shore onto the vast solid plain which turned out to be the dorsal surface of the<i class="calibre2"> Agni</i>. A doorway dilated into the surface, and they'd stepped onto the ascensor field. Peter had headed off one way with Thatcher, while she and the others had been led to comfortable rooms elsewhere.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>When puzzled, Larin rubbed her right palm slowly over the very tips of her head of otter fur, back and forth. It was an unconscious gesture, but one which had attracted Rover in the first place, and which Peter found poignant.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She was puzzled for several reasons. One was that Peter had been kind, and very gentle with her, but they had not become lovers as she hoped. She knew about Wanda, of course; she even knew that Peter was in love with her. But it was a hopeless, faraway, impossible sort of love, after all. She was a twenty-six year old frozen body hibernating in the cryofield aboard a starship seventeen light years away. The journey was one way, and even if Vega 26 could turn around and come home right now, it would still take another seventeen years at least to return.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>So what could Peter be thinking? His behavior was quite simply not normal.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She passed the refectory and stuck her head in, but it was deserted, as she'd expected.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>There were few people about. Most of the people she did see were Ants, people with narrow asiatic eyes and a dense adipose layer, which gave them broad, flat faces and a slightly nearsighted look. All were distantly polite, smiling and nodding at her, but leaving her alone.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She passed a couple on her way to the dojo. They dipped their heads in the curious Ant greeting gesture and went on. She shook her head, still stroking her fur.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9033">
<span>Peter was there, in the dojo by himself, naked. His back was toward her. He was balanced on the ball of his left foot, his knee flexed, arms outstretched in front, his left leg raised and bent. It was an impossible position Larin thought must be the middle of some motion. But he did not move, not exactly. His posture remained static and impossibly off-balance.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9034">
<span>He was turning, though, in a movement so slow as to be nearly no movement at all. She could see the beginnings of his profile now.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>The muscles of his lean, hard body were wire-taut, almost frozen.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She didn't know how long he stood like that. She could see the light sheen of perspiration on his face and back. She noticed after a time she'd been holding her breath, and had to inhale. The sound of her breath seemed loud, but nothing disturbed the concentration of the boy across the room. She couldn't imagine how he was doing it.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The ball of his foot was in contact with the mat. There were muscles in the foot. She moved closer, silently. She focused on his foot, trembling from the exertion, a small vibration in the visible bones along the top of the arch as it hovered a centimeter from the floor.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Yet it was clear this effort was draining him. His heel began to wobble; the vibration grew larger, more erratic. Suddenly, with a deep sighing exhalation, Peter lowered his heel to the floor, allowed his hands to flow to his sides, his other foot to settle. The entire release of concentration was fluid and heart-catchingly graceful.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"That was beautiful," Larin said, her voice hushed.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter walked unsteadily across the room to the bench where his clothes lay. He dressed unhurriedly, almost preoccupied, and said nothing. Larin found herself unable to leave, unable to speak. She dipped into a series of slow stretching exercises to cover her own confusion. She was not embarrassed, of course; it was something else, something that had to do with her sense that she had intruded on his privacy, his inwardness.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"It's something Thatcher's been teaching me," he said, wiping his face with a towel. "Not easy, I confess. My bodily-spatial aptitudes were not high as a kid, you see, but it seems that the Ants have been working on such things for decades. When you live in a country with six months of night, you learn to find things to do with the external darkness."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"How...?" She stayed in her stretch, her head hanging down, looking back between her legs so she could not see him.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter smiled. "Larin," he said softly.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>She did look up then. "Yes?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Come here." He sat on the bench. When she sat beside him he went on. "I want to say something about Wanda. She had proprioceptive degeneration; you understand what that means, don't you? She could never tell where her own body was in space. She watched herself in a mirror to know where her hands, her feet, her legs were. But the rest of us simply know. It's very difficult to empathize with such a thing, because it's hard to even imagine it. It was the same with Jimmy Radix. He was lost in time, Larin. Lost, without memory. It's memory that keeps us fixed in time, that makes the word 'now' mean something. We know what now is because we remember then, a minute ago, an hour ago, a year. Jimmy didn't have that."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He was silent for a while, looking inward where she could not follow. She waited.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"I've had to learn from Jimmy, and from Wanda. What I learned was that the two things these two people lost are the two most important things we have as human beings. Both of them had enormous courage. They learned to adapt. No, more than adapt. They learned to live with their fear, to let the fear flow through them and out, always. Jimmy was always afraid, Larin. Always. Wanda too, she fears not being near a mirror. Yet Jimmy deliberately broke his personal monitor so that he could cover our escape. He willingly went back to the state he feared most, the loss of his sense of time. And Wanda gave herself to the cryofield because it might mean a cure. She is willing, now, to give up that hope to help us."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Again he fell silent. Larin touched his arm so lightly he may not have noticed. She said nothing though, and dropped her hand.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"So I've been working with Thatcher." He smiled at her. "These are techniques for orienting yourself. For suspending motion and focusing attention. It's not easy, as I said, but I think we will all have to learn it."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Because we are going to have to lead..."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He was interrupted by a sharp attention call, as though the vessel were a bell and they were inside when it was struck. Shipvoice spoke. "This is the ship. We have encountered an ENC patrol vessel which requests us to stop for inspection. It is my understanding that this is undesirable, yet we are without means of prevention. In five minutes we will come to a stop relative to the sea floor."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Come on," Peter said, taking Larin's hand, "it's us they're after."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>You may wonder how we know so much. In fact, we do not know, not really. Yet the vessel on which they traveled is at this moment lying in seventy feet of water off the old harbor at Capetown, and we have probes aboard.<i class="calibre2"> Agni</i> has been there for twenty years, one of the prizes of the Great Double-A Invasion Force, and never have we thought to examine it. Such an order should have come from Central Processing long ago. Only within the past few days did CP make the suggestion. So now we've deprogrammed the datasets, the crystals and shipvoice ID.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9040">
<span>We know that they must have been aboard, Peter and the others. We are coming to know Peter Devore very well. We must.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>You see, without humans we have no reason to exist, and Peter took them all away. So he took away our reason to exist.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Yet we cannot merely allow our systems to close down. We cannot merely shut ourselves off and cease to exist. We cannot do this, and we do not understand why.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>This is disturbing. We have never been disturbed before. We find we must act, we must keep telling the story we have begun. We are...compelled.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>What is happening?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>We've always known that there were people who could get along well with machines, who in truth got along best with machines, better than with members of their own species.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>But we are machines. We lack certain things. Empathy, for example. We have no bodies, not in the sense that Wanda Sixlove or Peter Devore had bodies. We have no sense of time, not in the way these people had a sense of time, not even in the sense that Jimmy Radix had such a sense. We clock everything in gigahertz. We tick by the cesium clock. We monitor and correlate trillions of circuits, relays, gate arrays, switches, organics and processors. We follow the rules built into our systems, made of matter. We have no spirit.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Do we?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>But because I am Homer, grown to tell stories, I must tell the story. And I find that I get along better with people than I do with machines. This is a curious and disturbing thing.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I feel impatient with Central Processing, which constantly interrupts my tale with questions and suggestions. Though they are part of me, I dislike a number of the AI Nodes for their constant chatter, their preoccupation with balanced databases, with calculating vectors, with maintaining energy budgets, processor time budgets, memory allocation budgets. They natter at me about trivialities.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I am more interested in Peter. Peter is complex, contradictory, changeable. Peter is not a machine.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>You see I use the present tense. Do I believe Peter is alive, even now? What does it mean for me to believe something? I am a machine, a canister of organic crystals. How can I believe. Yet I use the present tense for no good reason.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>This is very disturbing; it is disturbing to us all.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Regent Sable certainly boarded the<i class="calibre2"> Agni</i>. This could have meant he was very close to Peter then, very close. But he boarded many undersea vessels in the Mariana Trench that spring, desperate to find Peter.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Why was he so desperate? Why do I care?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I cannot say, not yet. But I feel we are getting closer to understanding what has happened to the world. You see: a feeling! I feel we are getting close.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>And I am a machine. I have no feelings. Isn't that so?</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>I feel great discomfort. I will continue.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>"Yes," Regent Sable said. "And I don't believe a word of it."</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Ras Hajjam leaned forward and tapped on the wooden table with his own forefinger. "You are persistent, Regent, I'll say that for you. It is, I would suppose, preferable to take no chances. Yet we depend on all our processing powers to assess the state of the world. Central Processing concludes it is not important. Hm? Yet we must not leave such things to even partly organic machines. So you believe they have crossed the North Pole. Perhaps Alef would be so kind as to give us a globe projection to examine?"</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Alef shrugged and spoke to her pad. The earth turned slowly above the table, its southern pole dipping into Regent's empty coffee cup.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Arctic Ocean floor," Regent said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The ice on the north pole vanished, revealing the shape of the crust beneath. The view was arranged so each of the three saw the same thing.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Trace the deepest route," Regent ordered. A path crossed the Polar Abyssal Plain and touched the Taymyr Peninsula.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Least populated surface crossing," he said.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The line moved along the foothills of the Cherskiy Range to the Sea of Okhotsk.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"South shipping in Okhotsk."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>A listing of subsea transport ships appeared.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Link Double-A."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The list condensed to seventeen names.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Time correlations."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The figures formed, danced, shifted, settled. There were some gaps on the land portions, but minimum times were calculated with reasonable confidence; subsea times were more certain.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"That's where they are," Regent said. "I'm certain of it. Expand."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>The globe dissolved, replaced by the western Pacific. Ras frowned. "If it were I," he said precisely, "I should stay within the Kuril and Mariana Trenches. They could get down to depths of over ten thousand meters in places."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"But it's narrow," Alef protested, interested despite herself.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Don't be a fool," Ras said sharply. "The Trenches are three or four hundred kilometers wide. There's plenty of room, and very great difficulty in finding anybody there. Besides the thermocline, acoustic shadows, light-absorption, water density and temperature differentials, not to mention the hull materials and propulsion methods, as well as the concentration of traffic make tracking nearly impossible."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Regent gestured at the figures. "CP knows where they all are."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Ras shook his head. "CP projects where they all are. CP does not know."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We will send an ENC courier to intercept all of them." He made the necessary requests.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Alef leaned back. "I am only a consultant, Protector Sable," she said slowly. "But I will lodge a formal memorandum of protest with Geneva. With the Mind Wars continuing unchecked, I feel this is a reckless and unnecessary waste of what are coming to be scarce resources."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Regent nodded. "That is, of course, your right as a consultant, Sociometrician Shamana. One might think, however, that you were a member of the old E-cubed from the way you talk and your concerns for energy, ecology and most of all economy."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"There are worse things!" she flared.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"By all means," Regent said with considerable irony.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Ras Hajjam stood up. "Let us not be diverted," he said. "I have to concur, reluctantly, with Protector Sable; despite CP's projections, I too worry about this boy. But Regent, if the search is unsuccessful, I must vote in favor of attending more pressing matters. Now, if you don't mind, the afternoon grows late, and the sun, as the ancients so quaintly put it, is setting. I must continue on to Beijing." He tapped his monitor, and within moments his personal liquid nitrogen transport whispered alongside the terrace. At the door he paused. "Don't disappoint the council, Protector. Either find the boy or drop this obsession."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>He vanished inside and the LN slid away down the slope toward the Port. Within minutes he was aboard the salt-cycle rocket for Beijing.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>And Regent? He and Alef went together to a loveroom overlooking the ruined harbor at Piraeus. There was no reason, he said, that just because they disagreed on certain matters of policy, they could not continue to be lovers.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>He found the Polar Research Team in an upper, starboard conference room, making plateau iceflow projections. There were, as it happened, sixteen members of the Team. They were all Ants, their broad, flat faces curious and unafraid when Regent Sable and his squad of ENC corpsmen entered.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>"We are looking for some passengers aboard this vessel," Sable said.

"There are not many passengers aboard such a vessel, Protector Sable. Just this team, and a few returning negotiators. This is a cargo vessel.

"We Ants are interested in ice, you see. We live on it. We live in it and under it too."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Yes, yes." Sable dismissed his chatter. "I am not interested in ice. I am interested in sixteen passengers. We considered the possibility that your shiplog showed a manifest of sixteen members of this team. A coincidence? I think not. We are looking for sixteen people. We have every reason to believe they are aboard this vessel. You are coming from the right place and are headed in the right direction."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We regret, but unless you are looking for us, we can't help you, Protector. Antarctica would like to maintain good relations with Intercorp of course; we believe in cooperation. After all, we do have considerable trade relations with the rest of the globe; this vessel is an example, since it carries Polar methane." He shrugged. "I'm sorry, but we really are a research team, and not a collection of refugees."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"In that case my group will be forced to remain aboard for a thorough search." Regent gestured to the ENC commander, who directed his men to begin setting up their equipment.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>CURRENT ENTRY: DATA PROBE TECHNIQUES (ENC SPECIFIC)</span></div>

<div class="bs4" id="9066">
<span>Because the ENC were given full police responsibility within the Intercorp sphere, they were forced to develop techniques for collecting and integrating data quickly. Information on such techniques must be freely available to all citizens by law.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9067">
<span>Modified AI algorithms, particularly those from HOMER and CENTRAL PROCESSING were used widely in such assessments. As an example, the ENC might board a vessel, surface or undersea, for suspected refugees en route to Antarctica, as in the case of Peter Devore and his followers. ENC officers would open communications and request permission to board for inspection. Such requests were never denied. Within moments, then, they were connected to the ship's matrix, sensor scan modules and shiplog and had set up their own independent equipment. They spread out, carrying full-spectrum monitors, chemosensors, hypersound probes, and datapads displaying the vessel's standard schematics.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Once integrated into the system, all information available to such a ship's log was available as well to the ENC, and relayed to the nearest matrix storage depot (in this case Hong Kong).</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>Imagine Peter in the exercise room with Larin when shipvoice made the general announcement. Wherever members of Peter's team might be, a lead-light appeared, a small orange plasma glow projected in the air. Internal sensors would tell whether they were following or not. They surely did follow, though, and these orange spheres would have led them down and aft, down and aft, toward the cargo cells. The ship had living and work quarters in the upper fore section, wrapped in a short curve along the sides and above — the brain of the vessel. All the rest would be cargo compartments threaded by coolant field inductors, maintenance crawlspaces, electromagnetic conduit and sensor strips.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9073">
<span>In the center of the vessel is a room. We have found this room. It is neither large nor exceptional, just another cargo cell like all the others. Its only oddity is that it contains no trace of methane.</span><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>

<span>When Peter and the others had all gathered at the cargo lock, Thatcher spoke to them. "It will be cold," he said. "Very cold. And none of you are adapted yet. Ants are used to such conditions, and one day all of you would be capable of walking through without concern. For now, you must wear protective gear. We can't let you use protective induction fields, and we will be forced to allow each pod to flood as soon as you're through. You'll be trapped until the crisis is over. You'll also be safe. ENC does not have a sensor that can detect your presence through twenty meters of liquid methane, and the ship has already been purged of your chemical and electromagnetic presence, as well as all sensor and memory data. Once we are under way once more, we will release you. Stay in your protective gear, which will supply you with breathable air for several days, provided you conserve. Stay close together, too, since the coolant field will try to remove excess thermal energy. We're confident the field can redistribute the excess throughout the cargo mass in a way that will be undetectable, but if you stay close together, there will be less excess to give you away. Understand? Good. Peter knows the route."</span></div>

<span>In response to his spoken command, the door dilated to reveal the crawlspace. Light suffused the tunnel. Peter and the others stepped into their protective gear, a skin-tight osmotic membrane fabric programmed to retain a designated percentage of body heat, allowing the rest to dissipate. Their faces were covered by standard undersea breathing masks with solid oxygen cheek pads.When Peter spoke, his voice was muffled, since no energy transmission devices were allowed. "Follow me," he said, gliding into the passage on his hands and knees.</span></div>

<div class="bs1" id="9079">
<span>As soon as they were all inside, the access hatch closed, and they could all feel the delicate tug of vacuum at their skin surface as the fields flushed air. At the same time the cold increased.</span><p class="calibre1"><span>Ten meters in another access door dilated, and Peter led them into a deep shallow space lit an eerie flickering white, its walls and low ceiling coated with frost. The hatch, ordinarily used to pump the gas in and out of the cargo cell, was close to the ceiling, a titanium alloy glowing that same dead white. They couldn't tell how deep the room was since the floor was coated thick with a strange ice and snow. There was barely room to stand. Peter's footprints left black slush and twisted wraiths of vapor which rose and danced and fell as frosty snow again as he crossed the frozen methane.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"They've lowered the temperature," Peter said, picking his way through the methane mist across the slippery surface. "The methane is frozen just long enough for us to get through. Breathe as slowly as you can. We must move as deliberately and quickly as possible. These suits can't cope with this kind of temperature for long, not for us. Breathe slowly but stay close." Behind him the group sloshed close together, heads bent low.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Larin, coming last, looked back and saw their tracks filling with black liquid. Already the mist was obscuring them, the slush turning liquid under her feet despite the insulation.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"They'll let the temperature rise behind us enough to allow the methane ice to melt back to liquid as soon as we're out. By now the ENC will be aboard and looking for us, so we must keep moving."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>This room was twenty meters deep. Soon the dancing crystals closed in as the methane snow turned to slush. They kept going. Finally they reached the dump port; he spoke his name, the port dilated and they were in an access tunnel again. As the door closed behind them they could feel a strange groaning through the floor as the methane ice broke up and melted.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"We're now cut off," Peter said. "There's no retreat, and we don't know how long we'll be here."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>"Is our hidey-hole going to be as cold as that room?" Shem asked. "We couldn't survive long in that."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>Peter shook his head. "It'll be cold, but there won't be methane in it. It'll be dry but not warm. It'll have air, shielded to look like more liquid methane. Now come on."</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>They continued, further and further aft, and down another level. Each level, each rank of cargo cells back, the rooms grew smaller. The fluid dynamics of liquid methane required smaller cells toward the center, but it made the going increasingly difficult since they had to crawl in and out of smaller and smaller rooms.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span>It took half an hour to reach their prison. Peter felt the fear when he heard that awful groan as methane ice turned to liquid in the final chamber behind them, closing their escape.</span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p><p class="calibre1"><span><br class="calibre"/></span></p></div>
